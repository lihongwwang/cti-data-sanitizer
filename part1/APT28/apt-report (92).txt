regularly apply patches, users should first secure the way they set up their devices
and networks. Trend Micro™ Home Network Security solution can check internet
traffic between the router and all connected devices. Our IoT scanning tool has been
integrated into the Home Network Security solution and HouseCall™ for Home
Networks scanner. Enterprises can also monitor all ports and network protocols for
advanced threats and thwart targeted attacks with the Trend Micro™ Deep
Discovery™ Inspector network appliance.

Aside from adopting security solutions that can protect networks and connected
devices from the vulnerabilities through the identification and assessment of
potential risks, we recommend standard security measures, such as:

Updating the firmware versions of devices once they’re available to avoid attacks
that exploit known vulnerabilities.
Avoiding the use of public Wi-Fi on devices that are also used in home or corporate
networks.
Changing device’s default credentials and using strong passwords to deter
unauthorized access.
Being wary of suspicious URLs or attachments from unknown sources that may lead
to infecting devices connected to the network.
Users of the Trend Micro Home Network Security solution are also protected from
particular vulnerabilities via these rules:
