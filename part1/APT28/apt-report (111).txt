2018/12/14 A Song of Intel and Fancy | Exploiting Fancy Bear’s use of SSL certificate

A case study tracking adversary infrastructure through
SSL certificate use featuring Fancy Bear/APT28/Sofacy.
A long time ago, in a galaxy... No. Stop. We're not doing that anymore. Instead, we're pivoting to Game
of Thrones, or A Song of Ice and Fire for you bookworms, because the fantastical realm provides great
material we can relate to cybersecurity.

This research builds off our previous work using SSL certificates and splash pages
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/track-to-the-future/] to proactively identify Fancy Bear infrastructure. We
identified a SSL certificate subject string that Fancy Bear has used consistently since 2016, which
further illuminates their infrastructure and registration tactics. Our hope is that in addition to the
indicators themselves, our readers will apply these techniques to their research on other adversaries.

We'll walk through the process of how we conducted this research, which used ThreatConnect, Censys,
Farsight Security Passive DNS, RiskIQ, and DomainTools. To date, this line of research has identified 47
IPs, 46 domains, 33 registrant email addresses, and 47 SSL certificates shared in ThreatConnect in
Incident 20180209C: "C=GB, ST=London, L=London, O=Security, OU=IT" Certificate Infrastructure
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=909293473] . It also underscores
consistent Fancy Bear tactics including:

Use of small or boutique hosting service providers such as Domains4Bitcoins, ITitch, and NJALLA.
Minimizing the reuse of email addresses to register domains.
Regular use of email domains sapo[.]pt, mail[.]com, centrum[.]cz, and cock[.]li or privacy protection
services.
Domain registration and SSL certificate creation times that are consistent with an actor operating in
Moscow.

The Watchers in the Night

Everybody thinks they are House Stark material, but we would assert cybersecurity personnel are more
like the sworn members of the Night's Watch. You are the watchers on the firewall, the sword in the dark
web, and the shield that guards the networks of your organization.

If we're being honest, the ThreatConnect Research team and cyber threat intelligence analysts at large,
are most like... wait for it... Samwell Tarly (none of us harbors the delusion of being Jon Snow). Tarly is
dedicated to aggregating and analyzing intelligence on threats beyond the wall -- the Night King and his
White Walkers -- to better understand how the Night's Watch can react to them and proactively address
them.

Looking for Adversary Infrastructure Using a Common SSL Certificate Subject String

In our recent efforts to proactively address Fancy Bear, we reviewed SSL certificate information in
Censys for domains and IPs [https://www.censys.io/ipv4?
q=%22%3C%2Fh3%3E+%3Cp%3E522+Clematis.+Suite+3000+%3Cbr%2F%3E+West+Palm+Beach+FL+23
using a "Coming soon" splash page consistent with previously identified Fancy Bear infrastructure. We
found the same subject field used repeatedly -- "C=GB, ST=London, L=London, O=Security, OU=IT,
CN=(domain name)" -- as shown below for space-delivery[.]com [https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-
insight/post/apt28-racing-exploit-cve-2017-11292-flash-vulnerability-patches-are-deployed] and
webversionact[.]org.

Censys SSL certificate information showing consistent use of subject string.

 

This subject line indicates a SSL certificate likely created using OpenSSL, where the creator assigns
values for the country (C), state (ST), location (L), organization (O), organizational unit (OU), and common
name (CN). It is important to note that the common name is intended to reflect the domain name where
the SSL certificate is being used, but in our research we found several instances where this domain
name was misspelled or altogether different from the domain where it was used. More on that later.

 

Radiating out: how common is that subject string?

Next, we needed to get an idea of how widely this string is used and what other infrastructure is using
similar SSL certificates to gain insight into more possible Fancy Bear infrastructure. Again using Censys,
we found 47 certificates [https://www.censys.io/certificates?
q=%22C%3DGB%2C+ST%3DLondon%2C+L%3DLondon%2C+O%3DSecurity%2C+OU%3DIT%22&page=1

that have the same SSL string. In Censys we also queried for IP addresses that host a server using a
SSL certificate with that string. The latter provides a view of active infrastructure, while the former can be
used to find both historical and active infrastructure.

Censys certificate search results for identified subject string.

 

Careful though: other individuals could easily use OpenSSL to create certificates with the same subject
fields; this alone is not sufficient to identify Fancy Bear. Using ThreatConnect's Analyze function we saw
that at least 23 of the specified common names have been associated with Fancy Bear attacks. Many of
the remaining domains have also been identified through our ongoing research into name servers that
Fancy Bear uses. This increases our confidence in assessing that SSL certificates with that subject
string probably are associated with Fancy Bear activity.

Stitching together certificates, IP addresses, and the right domains

Censys SSL certificate information for 46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581.

 

At least 39 of the certificates identified in the previous query are no longer in use, but we used RiskIQ to
search for the SHA-1 hash and identified the IP addresses that previously hosted a server using that
certificate. For example, searching for the previously used SSL certificate
46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581, we saw that it was used at the IP 191.101.31.96.

RiskIQ SSL certificate information for 46ce0b05f302e0d855e9cc751100299345466581.

 

Reviewing this IP address in ThreatConnect using our integration with Farsight DNSDB
[https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/] , we saw that this IP address hosted the domain
remsupport[.]org. This is a notable finding as well because the domain does not correspond to the
ecitcom[.]net that was specified in the common name field in the certificate subject, so we took an extra
step to make sure we matched up the right certificate to the right domain.

 

ThreatConnect's Farsight Security Passive DNS integration results for 191.101.31.96.

 

Conducting this same process for all of the SSL certificates, we came up with the following list sorted by
the SSL certificate's create date/time:

Once that we had a list of the domains, we further enriched this information by identifying the WHOIS
information for these domains. Doing so provided historical information on how these domains were
registered.

Gathering Intelligence: Layering on WHOIS Data

To do so, we used some capabilities and integrations from our friends at DomainTools. Specifically, we
were looking to identify registrant email addresses, name servers/hosting providers, and creation
timestamps. We started by doing a DomainTools Iris search for the domains listed above.

DomainTools Iris search for identified domains.

 

This provided the current WHOIS information for those domains. However, some of the domains have
been taken over since they were operational or the WHOIS has otherwise changed since it was
registered for use in operations. For any domains where we thought this was the case, we reviewed the
WHOIS history in our DomainTools Spaces app to identify the original registration information that
corresponds to the timeframe in which the domain was operational.

Ultimately, we identified the below registration information for these domains.

Assessing Tactics

There are Fancy Bear tactics that we can glean and proactively exploit to identify their activity going
forward in addition to monitoring for new domains/IPs that use the aforementioned SSL certificate
subject string.

Hosting Service Providers/Name Servers 
The domains' original name servers helps identify the hosting service providers that the actors used to
procure the infrastructure. These include several providers that we've previously called out, such as
Domains4Bitcoins, ITitch, Nemohosts, Carbon2u and NJALLA. We can proactively monitor
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/duping-doping-domains/] for newly registered domains using these
name servers and with other consistencies to Fancy Bear to potentially identify their infrastructure before
it is used in operations.

Email Addresses

We used DomainTools Reverse WHOIS to search for any additional domains registered using the email
addresses above. As it turns out, only one of the email addresses -- iflatley@openmailbox[.]org --
registered a second domain (rndversion[.]net). This minimal reuse of email addresses suggests an
operational security (opsec) effort to deter efforts to trace out their infrastructure based on known
registrants.

DomainTools Reverse WHOIS results for iflatley@openmailbox[.]org.

 

While some of the domains were registered using privacy protection services, for those that aren't we
see the consistent use of sapo[.]pt, cock[.]li, centrum[.]cz, and mail[.]com. For those email domains that
are less common, like cock[.]li, we can create a Track in ThreatConnect that will alert us to any new
domains registered using that email domain.

Opsec Mistakes

When reviewing the SSL certificates, we identified several possible opsec mistakes that would either
arouse suspicion or allow defenders to trace out some of their infrastructure. As we mentioned earlier,
the common name in the SSL certificate field is intended to correspond to the domain name where it is
being used; however, for ten of the identified certificates, that wasn't the case. In some cases, the
domain name was misspelled, like the below certificate for cdnverify[.]net
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?
incident=856576992&owner=Common%20Community] . This mistake would be a red flag for defenders
looking to verify the legitimacy of encountered domains based on their SSL certificate.

In other certificates, a completely different common name was used, as was the case for the
aforementioned ecitcom[.]net. It turns out that ecitcom[.]net was the specified common name for five of
the certificates listed above. When we search Censys [https://www.censys.io/certificates?

2018/12/14 A Song of Intel and Fancy | Exploiting Fancy Bear’s use of SSL certificate

q=ecitcom.net] for other certificates using that common name, we find four more certificates that were
created from February 2016 to September 2016. This helps us identify the additional infrastructure
51.254.158[.]57, dowstem[.]com, 87.236.215.5, 185.61.149.24, and 80.83.115.187. Researchers can
exploit mistakes like these to expand their understanding of adversary infrastructure.

 

Creation Timestamps

Finally, we can make use of the creation timestamps for the identified certificates and domains. As the
chart below shows, a large majority of the certificates and domains were registered between 0600 and
1400 GMT. This is consistent with a 0900 to 1700 standard work day in Moscow. While not definitive --
other countries in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western Africa are in the same timezone -- in
conjunction with the previous associations to Fancy Bear this finding increases our confidence in the
attribution to Fancy Bear.

Moscow's time zone (MSK).

 

The registration and certificate creation times is of limited use to identify additional Fancy Bear domains
proactively - especially for a single indicator - but the consistency of the data set over time has value for
defenders and researchers.

 

Conclusion: To the Citadel!

We are sometimes asked why we share out these findings publicly, the argument being that we are
revealing research methodologies that Fancy Bear can now incorporate into their opsec and avoid in
future operations. That's a fair concern, but in response we argue that by publicizing these findings and
methodologies, we are hoping to show our readers ways to research not only Fancy Bear, but the other
Night Kings that keep them up at night.

 

Additionally, as we've stated before, in publicly outing or sharing these indicators and tactics,
organizations can ultimately increase the actors' costs and push them to spend more time and
resources on procuring infrastructure. The more this is done, the better. Eventually, you might get to the
point where you become a factor in the actor's decision making or cost benefit analysis.

Samwell Tarley's main source of intelligence, Castle Black's library, ultimately proves to be insufficient
for determining how to best the Night King. He then travels to the Citadel, a huge library of intelligence
consolidated from a variety of sources, in hopes of garnering knowledge that will help defend the realm.
For threat intelligence researchers and cybersecurity personnel, ThreatConnect acts as a metaphorical
Citadel, consolidating, aggregating, and analyzing intelligence from a range of internal and external

of Oldtown, ThreatConnect gives users the ability to actually act on the intelligence they receive and
integrate with the defensive tools they have in place to mitigate their threats. If you want to learn more,
