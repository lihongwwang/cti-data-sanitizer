MARCH 2017 UPDATE: The information about the combat losses of the 
D-30 artillery units suffered by Ukrainian forces has been updated with 
the latest analysis from Henry Boyd, International Institute for Strategic 
Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis 

K E Y  P O I N T S
• F rom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant  

was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a  
legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery  
officer Yaroslav Sherstuk. 

• T he original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly 
process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by 
Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to 
under 15 seconds. According to Sherstuk’s interviews with the press, 
over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the application in 
Ukrainian military. 

• S uccessful deployment of the FANCY BEAR malware within this 
application may have facilitated reconnaissance against Ukrainian 
troops. The ability of this malware to retrieve communications and 
gross locational data from an infected device makes it an attractive 
way to identify the general location of Ukrainian artillery forces  

“ and engage them.

In late June and August 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided initial 

reporting and technical analysis of a variant of the FANCY BEAR implant 

X-Agent that targeted the Android mobile platform2.  CrowdStrike 

“ identified this X-Agent variant within a legitimate Android application 

named Попр-Д30.apk. This app was developed and used by artillery 
C R O W D S T R I K E  troops to simplify targeting data for the D-30 towed howitzer. CrowdStrike 

I D E N T I F I E D  T H I S investigation reveals that this app has been utilized in a possible training 

X-A G E N T  VA R I A N T or operational role in at least one unit of the Ukrainian military. Therefore, 

W I T H I N  A  L E G I T I M AT E the implant likely targeted military artillery units operating against pro-

Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.

DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS  
OF  T H E BEN IG N  APPLICAT IO N
The original application central to this discussion, Попр-Д30.apk, was 

initially developed domestically within Ukraine by a member of the 55th 

Artillery Brigade. Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the 

app signing process, which occurred on 28 March 2013, CrowdStrike has 

determined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February 

and 13 April 2013. 

Shortly after that time frame, on 28 April 2013, an individual bearing the 

same name as the application’s developer promoted the application 

on Russian vKontakte3 pages associated with the artillery forces. The 

promotion of the program was likely limited to social media, and the 

distribution was controlled from the author’s main page, «Програмное 
обеспечение современного боя» (translation: "Modern combat software").4 

As an additional control measure, the program was only activated for  

use after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual 

downloading the application.

No evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app 

store, making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform. 

The control measures established by the developer to limit the use and 

proliferation of the Попр-Д30.apk application, coupled with its unique 

purpose, make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable.

“ At the time of this writing, it is unclear to what degree and for how  

T H E  O R I G I N A L ,  long this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the  

B E N I G N  A P P L I C AT I O N Ukrainian Artillery Forces. Based on open source reporting, social  

media posts, and video evidence, CrowdStrike assesses that Попр-Д30.apk 
E N A B L E D  A R T I L L E R Y 

was potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating  
F O R C E S  T O  M O R E  in eastern Ukraine.

R E D U C I N G  TA R G E T I N G RECONNAISSANCE

Given the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period 
T I M E  F R O M  M I N U T E S 

for the benign Попр-Д30.apk application, the program was likely available 
D O W N  T O  1 5  S E C O N D S . online for distribution after late April 2013. CrowdStrike Intelligence 

” assesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russia-

based adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian 



reconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine. Actors with a 

nexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better 

understand or formulate operations against their targets. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based 

actors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained 

from Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations. The 

most notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based 

threats directed against the Polish Government.5 In this particular case, 

the perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information 

from a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen, who was soliciting 

donations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine. The adversary 

then used this profile information, in conjunction with the name "Pravyy 

Sector," to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish 

government were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group. 

CrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive 

operation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though 

Ukrainian interests were threatening the Polish government. In addition, 

because the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to 

try to raise funds for Ukrainian forces, the adversary may have been trying to 

aggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual’s accounts. 

The attack did not appear to achieve its intended result. Poland rebuffed the 

threats, and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement 

in the threat. Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social 

media page of much of the information associated with this failed operation. 

This particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is 

staged. While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of 

the X-Agent Android variant, it demonstrates the reconnaissance and pre-

planning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign. Development  

and Distribution

CrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR 

likely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment, targeting 

"jailbroken" Apple mobile devices. The use of the X-Agent implant in the 

original Попр-Д30.apk application appears to be the first observed case 

of FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform. On 21 

December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first 

observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian 

military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development 

timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early 

December 2014. 



During that proposed development timeframe, a number of significant 

events unfolded between Ukraine, Russia, and the international 

community. Most notably, Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU 

relations resulted in the large-scale, Maidan protest movement, eventually 

resulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH, the invasion 

and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and the protracted 

armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, the creation of an application 

that targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense 

on the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary 

malware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the 

malicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign 

application was developed—brigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the 

frontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during 

the early stages of the conflict in late-2014. This assessment is based on a 

number of factors, but chief among them is the likelihood that a military 

“ member would only trust and use an application designed to calculate 

C R O W D S T R I K E  something as critical as targeting data if it was developed and promoted 

I N T E L L I G E N C E  H A S  by a member of their own forces. The type of operational activity described 

here suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that 
A S S E S S E D  T H AT  T H E  only a skilled adversary would likely possess. 

D I S T R I B U T I O N  O F  T H E  
M A L I C I O U S  A P P L I C AT I O N  By late December 2014, the total number of Russian forces in the region 

TA R G E T E D  T H E  V E R Y  was approximately 10,000 troops.6 Because the Android malware could 

A R T I L L E R Y  U N I T S  F O R facilitate gross position information, its successful deployment could 

have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop 
W H I C H  T H E  B E N I G N  movement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning 
A P P L I C AT I O N  WA S  information. Indeed, the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units 

D E V E L O P E D—B R I G A D E S operated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. 

O P E R AT I N G  I N  E A S T E R N A video posted on 18 October 20157 specifically shows them employing the 

U K R A I N E  O N  T H E  Попр-Д30.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine. 

F R O N T L I N E S  O F  T H E  The choice of the Russian language character set in the application further 
C O N F L I C T  W I T H  underscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine, as Russian is the 

R U S S I A N -B A C K E D  predominant language utilized in that region. An assessment of languages 

S E PA R AT I S T  F O R C E S spoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates 

D U R I N G T H E  E A R LY  the permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the 

value of providing Russian in the malicious Попр-Д30.apk application. 
S TA G E S  O F  T H E  C O N F L I C T  

I N  L AT E -2 0 1 4 . One alternative theory regarding the use of the Russian language in the 

” application could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian

forces operating in eastern Ukraine. A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory, however, is that Russian forces 

likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data, negating 

the need for an application to perform this task. Additionally, the application was initially developed by a member of the 

Ukrainian army. An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use on the battlefield. 

OU TC OME S AND CONCLUSION
The eastern Ukrainian front has been markedly impacted by heavy fighting involving Russian troops and pro-Russian 

rebel fighters deployed to this region. Artillery forces on both sides of the conflict have served an important role. For 

Ukrainian troops, artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost. According to an update provided in March 2017 by 

the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis, Henry Boyd, 

"excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale, the Ukrainian Armed 

Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war D–30 inventory in combat operations.

Between July and August 2014, Russian backed forces launched some of the most decisive attacks against Ukrainian 

forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry, and territory. According to open sources, Ukrainian service 

personnel from the 24th and 72nd Mechanized Brigade, as well as the 79th Airborne Brigade, were among the units to 

have suffered casualties. International monitoring groups later assessed some of the attacks were likely to have come 

from inside Russian territory.9  

A malware-infected Попр-Д30.apk application probably could not have provided all the necessary data required to 

directly facilitate the types of tactical strikes that occurred between July and August 2014. Eyewitness accounts from 

individuals within the impacted units reported seeing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in the area prior to one 

attack, underscoring the need for precise locational data for these particular strikes and introducing the possibility 



that the Android malware served to support the reconnaissance role of 

traditional battlefield assets. Although traditional overhead intelligence 

surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets were likely still needed 

to finalize tactical movements, the ability of this application to retrieve 

communications and gross locational data from infected devices, could 

provide insight for further planning, coordination, and tasking of ISR, 

artillery assets, and fighting forces. 

The X-Agent Android variant does not exhibit a destructive function and does 

not interfere with the function of the original Попр-Д30.apk  application. 

Therefore, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the likely role of 

this malware is strategic in nature. The capability of the malware includes 

gaining access to contacts, Short Message Service (SMS) text messages, 

call logs, and internet data, and FANCY BEAR would likely leverage this 

information for its intelligence and planning value. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential 

ability to map out a unit’s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, 

and even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic 

analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating 

and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting. 

The development of the X-Agent Android malware represents an expansion 

of FANCY BEAR capabilities in terms of mobile malware, and illustrates 

the practical application of full-spectrum combat as envisioned in the 

eponymous doctrinal writings of General Valery GERASIMOV. As a part 

“ of full-spectrum operations in Ukraine, Russia-based adversaries have 

leveraged malware on the battlefield, in the civil sector, and against 
C R O W D S T R I K E  

critical infrastructure. They have also engaged in aggressive information 
I N T E L L I G E N C E  A S S E S S E S operations in the media. In relation to this broader picture of Russian 

A  T O O L  S U C H  A S  T H I S computer operations, the approach to targeting mobile smartphone and 

H A S  T H E  P O T E N T I A L tablet devices in order to gain strategic insight into communications is a 

A B I L I T Y  T O  M A P  O U T  A tactic that cannot be disregarded. 

U N I T ’ S  C O M P O S I T I O N CrowdStrike assesses that the observed and described X-Agent implant 
A N D  H I E R A R C H Y,  targeting Ukrainian military Android devices running the Попр-Д30.apk  

D E T E R M I N E  T H E I R application is likely only the initial iteration of this type of malware. While 

P L A N S ,  A N D  E V E N  this malware was initially discovered in a battlefield environment, an 

T R I A N G U L AT E  T H E I R adversary could also leverage it in attacks against non-military targets. 

Mobile devices and internet-connected technology have increasingly 
A P P R O X I M AT E  L O C AT I O N proliferated civilian and military organizations. This technique may very 

” likely be deployed in the political, government, or non-governmental 

sectors in the near future.
