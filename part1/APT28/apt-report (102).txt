2018/12/7 VPNFilter EXIF to C2 mechanism analysed | Securelist
By GReAT on May 24, 2018. 6:00 pm

On May 23 2018, our colleagues from Cisco Talos published their excellent analysis of VPNFilter,
an IoT / router malware which exhibits some worrying characteristics.

Some of the things which stand out about VPNFilter are:

It has a redundant, multi-stage command and control mechanism which uses three different
channels to receive information
It has a multi-stage architecture, in which some of the more complex functionality runs only in
the memory of the infected devices
It contains a destructive payload which is capable of rendering the infected devices
unbootable
It uses a broken (or incorrect) RC4 implementation which has been observed before with the
BlackEnergy malware
Stage 2 command and control can be executed over TOR, meaning it will be hard to notice for
someone checking the network traffic

We’ve decided to look a bit into the C&C mechanism for the persistent malware payload. As
described in the Talos blog, this mechanism has several stages:

First, the malware tries to visit a number of gallery pages hosted on photobucket[.]com and
fetches the first image from the page.
If this fails, the malware tries fetching an image file from a hardcoded domain,
toknowall[.]com. This C2 domain is currently sinkholed by the FBI.
If that fails as well, the malware goes into a passive backdoor mode, in which it processes
network traffic on the infected device waiting for the attacker’s commands.

For the first two scenarios in which the malware successfully receives an image file, a C2
extraction subroutine is called which converts the image EXIF coordinates into an IPv4 address.
This is used as an easy way to avoid using DNS lookups to reach the C&C. Of course, in case this
fails, the malware will indeed lookup the hardcoded domain (toknowall[.]com). It may be worth
pointing that in the past, the BlackEnergy APT devs have shown a preference for using IP addresses
for C&C instead of hardcoded domain names, which can be easily sinkholed.

To analyse the EXIF processing mechanism, we looked into the sample
5f358afee76f2a74b1a3443c6012b27b, mentioned in the Talos blog. The sample is an i386 ELF
binary and is about 280KB in size.

Unfortunately for researchers, it appears that the photobucket.com galleries used by the malware
have been deleted, so the malware cannot use the first C2 mechanism anymore. For instance:

While looking at the pDNS history for this domain, we noticed that it resolved to an IP addresses in
France, at OVH, between Jan and Feb 2018:

Interestingly, when visiting this website’s C2 URL, we are presented with a JPG image, suggesting it
is still an active C2:

Here’s how it looks when viewed as an image:

When we look into the EXIF data for the picture, for instance using IrfanView, it looks as following:

How to get the IP out of these? The subroutine which calculates the C2 IP from the Latitude and
Longitude can be found at offset 0x08049160 in the sample.

As it turns out, VPNFilter implements an actual EXIF parser to get the required information.

First, it searches for a binary value 0xE1. This makes sense because the EXIF attribute information
begins with a tag “0xFF 0xE1”. Then, it verifies that the tag is followed by a string “Exif”. This is the
exact data that should appear in a correct header of the Exif tag:

Exif tag 
FF E1 Exif tag 
xx Length of field 
45 78 69 66 00 ‘Exif’ 
00 Padding

The tag is followed by an additional header:

“Attribute information” header 
49 49 (or 4D 4D) Byte order, ‘II’ for little endian (‘MM’ for big endian) 
2A 00 Fixed value 
xx xx Offset of the first IFD

The data following this header is supposed to be the actual “attribute information” that is
organized in so-called IFDs (Image File Directory) that are data records of a specific format. Each
IFD consists of the following data:

IFD record 
xx xx IFD tag 
xx xx Data type 
xx xx xx xx Number of data records of the same data type 
xx xx xx xx Offset of the actual data, from the beginning of the EXIF

The malware’s parser carefully traverses each record until it finds the one with a tag ’25 88′
(0x8825 little endian). This is the tag value for “GPS Info”. That IFD record is, in turn, a list of tagged
IFD records that hold separate values for latitude, longitude, timestamp, speed, etc. In our case,
the code is looking for the tags ‘2’ (latitude) and ‘4’ (longitude). The data for latitude and longitude
are stored as three values in the “rational” format : two 32-bit values, the first is the enumerator
and the second one is the denominator. Each of these three values corresponds to degrees,
minutes and seconds, respectively.

Then, for each record of interest, the code extracts the enumerator part and produces a string of
three integers (i.e. “97 30 4294967121” and “4294967178 140 4294967274″ that will be displayed
by a typical EXIF parser as 1193143 deg 55′ 21.00″, 4296160226 deg 47′ 54.00”). Then, curiously
enough, it uses sscanf() to convert these strings back to integers. This may indicate that the GPS
Info parser was taken from a third-party source file and used as-is. The extracted integers are then
used to produce an actual IP address. The pseudocode in C is as follows: 

const char lat[] = "97 30 4294967121"; // from Exif data 
const char lon[] = "4294967178 140 4294967274"; // from Exif data 
int o1p1, o1p2, o2p1, o3p1, o3p2, o4p1; 
uint8_t octets[4];

sscanf(lat, "%d %d %d", &o1p2, &o1p1, &o2p1); 
sscanf(lon, "%d %d %d", &o3p2, &o3p1, &o4p1); 
octets[0] = o1p1 + ( o1p2 + 0x5A ); 
octets[1] = o2p1 + ( o1p2 + 0x5A ); 
octets[2] = o3p1 + ( o3p2 + 0xB4 );

printf("%u.%u.%u.%u\n", octets[0], octets[1], octets[2], octets[3]);

The implementation of the EXIF parser appears to be pretty generic. The fact that it correctly
handles the byte order (swapping the data, if required) and traverses all EXIF records skipping them
correctly, and that the GPS data is converted to a string and then back to integers most likely
indicates that the code was reused from an EXIF-parsing library or toolkit.

For the values provided here, the code will produce the IP address “217.12.202.40” that is a known
C&C of VPNFilter.

It should be noted that this IP is included in Cisco Talos’ IOCs list as a known C&C. Currently, it
appears to be down.

What’s next?
Perhaps the most interesting question is who is behind VPNFilter. In their Affidavit for sinkholing
the malware C2, FBI suggests it is related to Sofacy:

Interestingly, the same Affidavit contains the following phrase: “Sofacy Group, also known as
apt28, sandworm, x-agent, pawn storm, fancy bear and sednit”. This would suggest that
Sandworm, also known as BlackEnergy APT, is regarded as subgroup of Sofacy by the FBI. Most
threat intel companies have held these groups separate before, although their activity is known to
have overlapped in several cases.

Perhaps the most interesting technical detail, which Cisco Talos points in their blog linking
VPNFilter to BlackEnergy, is the usage of a flawed RC4 algorithm.The RC4 key scheduling
algorithm implementation from these is missing the typical “swap” at the end of the loop. While
rare, this mistake or perhaps optimization from BlackEnergy, has been spotted by researchers and
described publicly going as far back as 2010. For instance, Joe Stewart’s excellent analysis of
Blackenergy2 explains this peculiarity.

So, is VPNFilter related to BlackEnergy? If we are to consider only the RC4 key scheduling
implementation alone, we can say there is only a low confidence link. However, it should be noted
that BlackEnergy is known to have deployed router malware going back as far as 2014, which we
described in our blogpost: “BE2 custom plugins, router abuse, and target profiles“. We continue to
look for other similarities which could support this theory.

Is it possible to get a sample for one of the jpg images? I want to dynamically analyse the stage
1 sample but the C&C servers are down and I can’t get the malware to download the picture. I
want to simulate my own server for that. thanks  
