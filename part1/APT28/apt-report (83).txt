Introduction 

Advanced Persistent Threat group, APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, 
the Sednit Gang and Sofacy), is a highly skilled threat actor, best known for its 
disruptive cyber activity against the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) and 
the French channel TV5 Monde. 
 
According to publicly available information, APT28 has previously used tools including 
X-Tunnel, X-Agent and CompuTrace to penetrate target networks. These tools can be 
used to hook into system drivers and access local passwords and the LDAP server. 
Reported capabilities include monitoring keystrokes and mouse movements, 
accessing webcams and USB drives, searching and replacing local files and 
maintaining a persistent connection. 
 
The signatures and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) included in this advisory will 
assist in detecting APT28 malware. Network based signatures alone will not guarantee 
successful identification of APT28 in a network. Many of the communication modules 
used by the actor are wrapped in protocols such as SSL/TLS, with the intention of 
evading content-based signatures.  
 
Please use the indicators in this NCSC advisory to check for the presence of this 
malware on your platforms and networks. 

 

Detecting known APT28 tools 

X-AGENT  
 
X-AGENT (Also known as CHOPSTICK) is a second-stage modular remote access 
trojan (RAT). It can run on Windows, iOS and Unix-based operating systems.  

Functions of X-AGENT include key logging and file extraction. It is often used after 
first stage malware such as CORESHELL or GAMEFISH. X-AGENT is likely to be 
used in conjunction with XTUNNEL and CompuTrace/Lojack. Recent versions of X-
AGENT use SSL/TLS to encrypt the communications. 

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) 

The following IP addresses and domains have been used for X-AGENT Command 
and Control (C2) servers, to communicate with victims:

Snort Rules 

The following snort rules can be used to detect X-Agent communications between 
Command and Control (C2) servers and victims: 

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow: 
established,from_client; msg: "XAgent Beacon"; content: 
"HTTP/1.1|0d 0a|Accept|3a| 
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml|3b|q=0.9,*"; 
!"Host|3a| yandex.ru";; pcre: "/^(?:GET|POST) 
\/(?:watch|search|find|results|open|search|close)\/\?(?:text=|from
=|aq=|ai=|ags=|oe=|btnG=|oprnd=|utm=|channel=|itwm=)/";) 
  
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow: 
established,from_client; msg:: "XAgent itwm beacon v1"; content: 
"/?itwm"; fast_pattern; pcre: "/itwm=[A-Za-z0-9\-\_]{29,35}/";) 
 
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow:

CompuTrace  
 

CompuTrace/Lojack is a legitimate piece of software, which can track and assist in the 
recovery of lost or stolen laptops as well as remotely locking and deleting files.  

APT28 have modified this software. Exploitation of this software enables persistence 
on the victim's operating system, as well as the ability to modify the system memory 
and retrieve additional modules through the installed modified CompuTrace/Lojack 
agent.

Snort Rules 

The following snort rule can be used to detect CompuTrace communications from 
victims: 
 
Please note: The Snort rule provided may detect false positives due to 
CompuTrace/Lojack being legitimate software. The NCSC highly recommend

network administrators assess their environment for the presence of 
CompuTrace/Lojack and adjust the signatures accordingly to exclude the legitimate 
use of CompuTrace.

XTUNNEL  
 
 
X-TUNNEL (XTUNNEL) is a network tunnelling tool that is used for network traversal 
and pivoting. It provides a secure tunnel to an external command and control server, 
through which the actors can operate using a variety of standard networking tools and 
protocols to connect to internal services.

ZEBROCY 
 
ZEBROCY is a tool used by APT28, which has been observed since late 2015. The 
communications module used by ZEBROCY transmits using HTTP. The implant has 
key logging and file exfiltration functionality and utilises a file collection capability that 
identifies files with particular extensions. 

The primary deployment mechanism for ZEBROCY has been spear-phishing emails, 
in which the payload runs systeminfo, tasklist and also takes a screenshot. 

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) 

The following IP addresses have been used for ZEBROCY victim communications:

Snort Rules 

The following snort rule can be used to detect a string present in ZEBROCY victim 
communications: 

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow: 
established,from_client; msg: "APT28 - Web/request -FILE- content-
type"; content: "-FILE-"; pcre: "/[A-Z0-9\-]{16}-FILE-

Mitigation 
 
Follow the high-level security mitigations detailed in the NCSC mitigating 
malware guidance (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware) and in 
the Preventing Lateral Movement guidance 
(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement).  
 
For additional mitigations for Windows 10 follow the NCSC Windows 10 EUD 
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-windows-10-
1703. This guidance details how to configure AppLocker to help prevent malicious 
applications from running on end user devices. 
 
Deploy SysMon. Microsoft SysInternals Tool SysMon, is able to monitor and log 
system activity to the Windows Event Log. It can provide information about process 
creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time.  
 
By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM 
agents, and subsequently analysing them, Network Defenders and System 
Administrators can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how 
intruders and malware operate on their networks.   
 
To help reduce the risk of PowerShell being used as an attack vector on the 
network, these two pieces of guidance will help:  

• https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/powershell-security-
risks-and-defenses.cfm  

• https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/securing-powershell.htm 
 
Manage macros carefully: 

• Disable Office macros except in the specific apps where they are required 
• Only enable macros for users that need them day-to-day 
• Ensure these users understand how harmful macros can be, and treat 

macros from untrusted sources with extreme caution 
• Use a recent and fully patched version of Office.  
• The underlying platform should, ideally, be configured in line with the 

NCSC’s EUD Security Guidance. See NCSC Guidance: 
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-security and 
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office 

 
Layer phishing defences. Detect and quarantine as many malicious email 
attachments and as much spam as possible, before they reach your end users. 
Multiple layers of defence will greatly cut the chances of a compromise. 

• Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report 
suspected phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so.

Investigate their reports promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for 
clicking phishing links or opening attachments. 

See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing 
  
Consider implementing a Security Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) solution to centrally collate logs from SysMon and Windows Event Logs.  
 
Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be 
needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC Guidance: 
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes
