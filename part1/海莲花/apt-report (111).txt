OceanLotus for OS X – an Application
Bundle Pretending to be an Adobe

Flash Update
FEBRUARY 17, 2016 | EDDIE LEE (HTTPS://WWW.ALIENVAULT.COM/BLOGS/AUTHOR/ELEE)

In May 2015, researchers at Qihoo 360 published a report on OceanLotus that included details about malware
targeting Chinese infrastructure. In that report, there is a description about a piece of malware that targets OS X
systems. A sample of that malware was uploaded to VirusTotal a few months ago. Curiously, as of February 8th,
2016, none of the 55 anti-virus solutions used by VirusTotal are detecting the sample as malicious. As such, we
thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at the OS X version of OceanLotus.

Analysis
OceanLotus for OS X is packaged as an application bundle pretending to be an Adobe Flash update. Although
there are other files in the bundle, the files of interest are:

FlashUpdate.app/Contents/MacOS/EmptyApplication
FlashUpdate.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/.en_icon
FlashUpdate.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/.DS_Stores

The Loader

As you can see below, EmptyApplication is a universal binary that can run on both i386 and x86_64
architectures. It is a fairly simple program that ROL3 decodes the "hidden" files .en_icon and .DS_Stores then
executes them.

$file EmptyApplication 
EmptyApplication: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures 
EmptyApplication (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 
EmptyApplication (for architecture i386): Mach-O executable i386

For obfuscation, EmptyApplication uses XOR encryption with the key "xc" to obfuscate strings within the binary.
Below is the simple decryption function.

In the 64-bit version, strings shorter than 8 bytes are stored as integer values. Encrypted strings longer than 8
bytes are stored in adjacent variables and the decrypting function reads past the variable's 8 byte boundary. As
you can see below, &v34 is passed to the decrypting function, but the function actually decrypts the
combination of v34 and v35.

After decoding .en_icon, EmptyApplication writes it to a temporary directory with the name "pboard"
(presumably to mimic the OS X paste board daemon) and executes the binary. EmptyApplication then deletes
itself, decodes .DS_Stores, and writes the decoded binary as "EmptyApplication" – replacing the original
EmptyApplication executable. Finally, the new EmptyApplication is relaunched with a call to NSTask.launch().
The decrypted .DS_Stores binary does almost the same thing as the original EmptyApplication, except it does
not look for .DS_Stores.

The Trojan

Encrypted Strings

The decoded .en_icon file is the main Trojan. It has anti-debugging capabilities and handles the connection to
the command and control servers. As we'll discuss later, the Trojan takes advantage of several OS X specific
commands and API calls, so it's clear that this Trojan was tailor-made for OS X rather than a port from another
operating system.

Again, most strings in the binary are XOR encrypted but this binary uses multiple keys and the keys themselves
are XOR encrypted. In fact, the first thing the Trojan does is to decrypt several XOR keys. It is interesting to note
that the code that sets up the decryption keys is executed before the "main" entry point by using C++ static
constructors. This code is referenced in the __mod_init_func section of mach-o binaries.

(https://cdn.alienvault.com/images/uploads/OceanLotus_encrypted_strings.png)

As you can see from the image above, the primary decryption key used throughout the executable is "Variable".
However, there are several different instances of the "Variable" string, and it would be trivial for the authors to
update the code to use different decryption keys through the code. Although XOR decryption is simple by
nature, using such a scheme makes reverse engineering a tedious process. Below is the decryption function,
which is similar to the function used in EmptyApplication, except this version takes a variable decryption key.

Anti-Debugging

To prevent debuggers from attaching to itself, the Trojan calls ptrace() with the PT_DENY_ATTACH argument.
Furthermore, it creates a signal handler to catch SIGTRAPs, calls "int 3" to throw a SIGTRAP, sets a flag in the
SIGTRAP handler and checks the flag value before it continues to run. This is more of an annoyance than
anything novel in terms of anti-debugging.

Next, before moving on to the meat of the code, the Trojan performs a signature check on itself by looking at
the last 27 bytes of the binary. The first 11 bytes of the 27 bytes must match a hardcoded value in the binary and
the final 16 bytes must be the MD5 hash of the binary minus the last 27 bytes.

Persistence

This first real bit of trojan functionality that is performed is to set up a Launch Agent for persistence – the
Launch Agent will run every time a user logs in. The Trojan copies itself to ~/Library/Logs/.Logs/corevideosd (or
/Library/Logs/.Logs/corevideosd if it has root permissions) and creates a Launch Agent plist at
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.plugins.plist (or /Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.plugins.plist) that
references the corevideosd executable.

In addition to using "hidden" dot directories, the Trojan calls chflags(filename, UF_HIDDEN) on the corevideosd
and com.google.plugins.plist files. The final step that is taken to lower its profile is to call 'xattr -d -r
com.apple.quarantine "PATH to corevideosd"' to remove the quarantine extended attribute from corevideosd. If
the Launch Agent is already running, the command "/bin/launchctl unload

"/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.plugins.plist" is used to unload itself before relaunching corevideosd.

Command and Control Communication

The Trojan attempts to contact multiple command and control servers(C2s) to retrieve commands and
additional payloads. The first C2 it attempts to connect to is kiifd[.]pozon7[.]net on port 80 using HTTP. Below is
an example of a check-in request.

(https://cdn.alienvault.com/images/uploads/OceanLotus_80_c2.png)

Here, 1AD6A35F4C2D73593912F9F9E1A55097 is the MD5 hash of the IOPlatformUUID. The IOPlatformUUID is
obtained by executing the OS X specific command:

/usr/sbin/ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | grep 'IOPlatformUUID'

This UUID is also written locally to ~/Library/Preferences/.fDTYuRs. Before being written to disk, the UUID is
XOR encrypted using the key "pth".

Currently, kiifd[.]pozon7[.]net is down, however, the Trojan is coded to download and execute an additional
payload if the C2 tells it to. It can run an executable file or open a zipped application bundle (.app application).

After contacting the first C2, the Trojan checks a local file ~/Library/Parallels/.cfg (or /Library/Parallels/.cfg) for a
list of executables or applications to run. ~/Library/Parallels/.cfg is essentially a "Startup Items" file that contains
a list of programs to run when the Trojan first starts up. Although the Chinese report says that OceanLotus MAC
can detect the Parallels virtual environment, we do not think this is the case. OceanLotus MAC simply stores a
hidden configuration file in the /Library/Parallels/ directory.

Next the Trojan performs a check-in to an "encrypted" C2. It first attempts to connect to shop[.]ownpro[.]net, but
if that host is down then it will fallback to pad[.]werzo[.]net. The network communication is made over port 443
but does not use SSL. Instead data is encrypted with a single byte XOR key of 0x1B. During the initial check-in,
the victim does not send any data that is unique to the compromised host.

After confirming successful communication with the C2, the Trojan gets ready to start handling commands from
the C2. It starts by creating a keep-alive thread to "ping" the C2 every minute. Then it gathers the following
information about the system and current user:

Product Name and Version (read from /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist)
Machine name
Is the user root
User's name (from pw_gecos)
Username
MD5 hash of the IOPlatformUUID (If IOPlatformUUID can't be found, then a combination of username and
machine name is used as a unique ID)

In addition to the system and user information, the Trojan will obtain the current time from www.microsoft.com.
It does this by making an HTTP request to www.microsoft.com and parsing the Data header from the response.
There is actually an error in the request - the request made to www.microsoft.com looks like:

(https://cdn.alienvault.com/images/uploads/OceanLotus_Microsoft.png)

As you can see, there is no path in the request and the server responds with a 400. Since the Trojan only cares
about the Date header in the response, the failed request still works. The parsed date is converted to epoch
time and stored in ~/Library/Hash/.Hashtag/.hash (or /Library/Hash/.Hashtag/.hash). Here, there is another error
in the code where the Trojan attempts to read the time from ~/Library/Hash/.hash and misses the .HashTag
directory. In addition to the timestamp, the values "th" and 1 are also stored in the file and the entire contents
are XOR encrypted with the key "camon".

The system and user information is sent to the C2 and finally a new thread is created to handle commands from
the C2. Below is a dump of the encrypted communication to the C2.

(https://cdn.alienvault.com/images/uploads/OceanLotus_enc_c2_edit.png)

Decoding the system information block with the key 0x1B results in the following data – highlighted are the
product name, OS version, username, machine name, and IOPlatformUUID MD5 hash.

After sending the system and user information to the C2, this thread attempts to read from the C2 every
second, however, it appears that the C2 only sends data once every 5 seconds. If the response from the C2
contains a command directive, the Trojan will execute one of those commands. The following strings were
decrypted from the binary and are likely part of an interactive command console on the C2 side.

Usage: ls [path] 
Usage: cd <path> 
Usage: pwd 
Usage: rm <file_path> 
Usage: cp <srcpath> <dstpath> 
Usage: mv <srcpath> <dstpath> 
Usage: ps 
Usage: proc <pid> 
Usage: kill <pid> 
Usage: exec <path> 
Usage: info [path] 
Usage: cmd <command system> 
Usage: localip 
Usage: recent 
Usage: windows 
Usage: download fromURL savePath 
Usage: cat path [num_byte] 
Usage: capture <saved_path> 
where

With the exception of a few commands these are self-explanatory.

"exec" opens an application bundle (.app directory) by calling system("open <APP Bundle>")

"info" returns information about a file or path

"recent" returns a list of recently opened documents. This done by calling LSSharedFileListCreate(0,
kLSSharedFileListRecentDocumentItems, 0);

"windows" returns information about the currently open windows on the system (e.g. which process owns the
window.). This is done with a call to CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo()

"capture" saves a screenshot of the current desktop to the specified path. This is done by executing the
command: "/usr/sbin/screencapture -x <PATH>" (the -x option prevents the shutter sound from being played)

"where" is missing a usage statement, but it is accepted as a command and returns the full path of the running
Trojan. This done by executing: "ps awx | awk '$1 == [PID] {print $5}" where PID is the current process ID.

In addition to the above functionality, there are commands codes that allow the C2 to perform the following
actions (there is some overlap with the previous commands):

Update the /Library/Hash/.Hashtag/.hash file
Update or read the /Library/Parallels/.cfg file
Automatically download files from a URL
Unzip and open a zipped application bundle, run an executable file, or execute code from a dynamic library.
Kill a process
Delete a file or path
Shutdown the connection to the C2

Summary
The OS X version of OceanLotus is clearly a mature piece of malware that is written specifically for OS X. The
use of OS X specific commands and APIs is evidence that the authors are intimately familiar with the operating
system and have spent quite a bit of time customizing it for the OS X environment. Similar to other advanced
malware, the use of obfuscation and indirection within the binary are an indication that the authors want to
protect their work, make it difficult for others to reverse engineer, and reduce detection rates. The fact that
VirusTotal still shows a zero detection rate for this threat shows they are succeeding at the latter.

We also found a version of OceanLotus that appears to be much simpler. It still communicates with the
hardcoded C2 at kiifd[.]pozon7[.]net over port 80, but does not connect to an encrypted C2. This version does
not launch multiple threads to handle other tasks and seems less developed so it is most likely an earlier
version. We did not perform an in-depth analysis of this earlier variant, however, it could be in interesting
exercise to see how the malware has evolved over time.
