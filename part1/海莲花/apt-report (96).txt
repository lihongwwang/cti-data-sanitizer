We identified a MacOS backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as  OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D) that we believe is the latest version of
a threat used by OceanLotus (a.k.a. APT 32, APT-C-00, SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty). OceanLotus was responsible for
launching targeted attacks against human rights organizations, media organizations, research institutes, and maritime
construction firms. The attackers behind OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D target MacOS computers which have the Perl programming
language installed.

The MacOS backdoor was found in a malicious Word document presumably distributed via email. The document bears the
filename “2018-PHIẾU  GHI  DANH  THAM  DỰ  TĨNH  HỘI HMDC 2018.doc,” which translates to “2018-REGISTRATION
FORM OF HMDC ASSEMBLY 2018.doc.” The document claims to be a registration form for an event with HDMC, an
organization in Vietnam that advertises national independence and democracy.

Figure 1. Graphic used by the malicious document

Upon receiving the malicious document, the user is advised to enable macros. In our analysis, the macro is obfuscated,
character by character, using the decimal ASCII code. This is shown in the figure below.

Figure 2. Code snippet of the obfuscated document

After deobfuscation, we can see that the payload is written in the Perl programming language. It extracts theme0.xml file from
the Word document. theme0.xml is a Mach-O 32-bit executable with a  0xFEEDFACE signature that is also the dropper of
the backdoor, which is the final payload. theme0.xml is extracted to /tmp/system/word/theme/syslogd before it’s executed.

Dropper analysis

The dropper is used to install the backdoor into the infected system and establish its persistence.

Figure 4. The main function of the dropper

All strings within the dropper, as well as the backdoor, are encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256 key. There are two forms of
encrypted strings: an RSA256-encrypted string, and custom base64-encoded and RSA256-encrypted string.

Figure 5. Hardcoded RSA256 key showing the first 20 characters

Using the setStartup() method, the dropper first checks if it is running as a root or not. Based on that, the
GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the hardcoded path and filename where the backdoor
should be installed. The locations:

For root user

path: /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/iOSScreenCapture.plugin/Contents/Resources/ 
processname: screenassistantd

2018/12/14 New MacOS Backdoor Linked to OceanLotus Found - TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog
For regular user

path: ~/Library/Spelling/ 
processname: spellagentd

Subsequently, it implements the Loader::installLoader method, reading the hardcoded 64-bit Mach-O executable (magic value
0xFEEDFACF), and writing to the previously determined path and file.

Figure 6. The dropper installs the backdoor, sets its attributes to “hidden”, and sets a random file date and time

When the dropper installs the backdoor, it sets its attributes to “hidden” and sets file date and time to  random values using
the touch command: touch –t YYMMDDMM “/path/filename” > /dev/null. The access permissions will then be changed to
0x1ed = 755, which is equal to u=rwx,go=rx.

Figure 7. The magic value 0xFEEDFACF that belongs to Mach-O Executable (64 bit)

Methods GET_LAUNCHNAME and GET_LABELNAME will return the hardcoded name of the property list “.plist” for the root
user (com.apple.screen.assistantd.plist) and for the regular user (com.apple.spell.agent.plist).

Afterwards, the persistence file will be created in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or ~/Library/LaunchAgents/  folder. The
RunAtLoad key will command launchd to run the daemon when the operating system starts up, while the KeepAlive key will
command launchd to let the process run indefinitely. This persistence file is also set to hidden with a randomly generated file
date and time.

Figure 8. Property list with persistence settings

launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/filename.plist > /dev/nul or launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ filename.plist >
/dev/nul will then command the operating system to start the dropped backdoor file at login. The dropper will delete itself at
the end of the process.

Backdoor analysis

The main loop of the backdoor has two main functions, infoClient and runHandle. infoClient is reponsible for collecting OS
info, submitting this info to its C&C servers (the servers are malicious in nature), and receiving additional C&C communication
information. Meanwhile, runHandle is responsible for the backdoor capabilities.

Figure 9. The main functions of the backdoor

infoClient fills up the variables in HandlePP class.

Figure 10. List of variables belonging to the HandlePP class

clientID is an MD5 hash derived from the environment variables, while strClientID is a hexadecimal representation of clientID.
All strings below are encrypted via AES256 and base64 encoding. The HandlePP::getClientID method uses the following
environment variables:

Figure 11. Serial number

Figure 12. Hardware UUID

Figure 13. MAC address

Figure 14. Randomly generated UUID

For the initial information packet, the backdoor also collects the following:

Figure 15. OS version

Running getpwuid ->pw_name , scutil – -get ComputerName, and uname –m will provide the following returns respectively:

Mac OSX 10.12.
System Administrator
<owner’s name>’s iMac
x86_64

All these data are scrambled and encrypted before sending to the C&C server.  The process is detailed below:

1. Scrambling

Class Parser has several methods, one for each variable type – Parser::inBytes, Parser::inByte, Parser::inString, and
Parser::inInt.

Figure 16. Parser::inBytes method

If clientID equals the following sequence of bytes B4 B1 47 BC 52 28 28 73 1F 1A 01 6B FA 72 C0 73, then the scrambled
version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is treated as a DWORD. Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with
it, as shown in example below.

 Figure 17. Parser::inByte method

2018/12/14 New MacOS Backdoor Linked to OceanLotus Found - TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog
When scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even. If the value is odd, it adds the byte,
along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array. In the case of an even value, the randomly generated byte is
added first, followed by the byte being added. In the case above, the third parameter is ‘1’ = 0x31, which is an odd number.
This means that it adds byte ‘1’ and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled array.

Figure 18. Parser::inString method

When scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence. First, it generates one random byte, followed by
three zero bytes, one random byte, and finally, the byte with the length of the string. Let’s say we want to scramble string
‘Mac OSX 10.12.’ Its length is 13 = 0x0d, and the two random bytes are 0xf3 and 0x92.  The final 5-byte sequence looks like
F3 00 00 00 92 0D. The original string is then XOR’ed with the 5-byte sequence.

Figure 19. Scrambling ‘Mac OSX 10.12’

2. Encryption

The scrambled byte sequence is passed onto the constructor of the class Packet::Packet, which creates a random AES256
key and encrypts the buffer with this key.

3. Encoding the encryption key

In order for the C&C server to decrypt the encrypted data, the randomly generated AES256 key must be included in the
packet along with the encrypted data. However, this key is also scrambled with operation XOR 0x13 followed by ROL 6
operation applied to each byte.

Some screenshots taken during scrambling and encryption process:

Figure 25. Screenshot of the final payload to be sent to C&C server. The scrambled AES256 key is marked green, while the
encrypted computer info is marked red. Other bytes are just randomly generated noise.

When the backdoor receives the response from the C&C server, the final payload needs to be decoded again in a similar
manner via decryption and scrambling. Packet::getData decrypts the received payload and Converter::outString descrambles
the result.

The received data from the C&C server include the following information:

HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css)
HandlePP::keyDecrypt
STRINGDATA::BROWSER_SESSION_ID (m_pixel_ratio)
STRINGDATA::RESOURCE_ID

These data will be later used in the C&C communication, as shown in the Wireshark screenshot below.

Meanwhile, the runHandle method of the main backdoor loop will call for the requestServer method with the following
backdoor commands (each command has one byte long code and is extracted by Packet::getCommand):

Figure 27. The getCommand method

The figure below shows the example of two of several possible command codes. Both create one thread, and each thread is
responsible for either downloading and executing the file or running a command line program in the terminal:
