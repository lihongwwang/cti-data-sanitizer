CHINA  ESPIONAGE  APT

From at least January to April 2020, suspected Vietnamese actors APT32 carried out intrusion
campaigns against Chinese targets that Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes was designed to
collect intelligence on the COVID-19 crisis. Spear phishing messages were sent by the actor to
China's Ministry of Emergency Management as well as the government of Wuhan province,
where COVID-19 was first identified. While targeting of East Asia is consistent with the activity
we’ve previously reported on APT32, this incident, and other publicly reported intrusions, are
part of a global increase in cyber espionage related to the crisis, carried out by states
desperately seeking solutions and nonpublic information.

Phishing Emails with Tracking Links Target Chinese Government

The first known instance of this campaign was on Jan. 6, 2020, when APT32 sent an email with
an embedded tracking link (Figure 1) to China's Ministry of Emergency Management using the
sender address lijianxiang1870@163[.]com and the subject 第⼀期办公设备招标结果报
告 (translation: Report on the first quarter results of office equipment bids). The embedded link
contained the victim's email address and code to report back to the actors if the email was
opened.

Mandiant Threat Intelligence uncovered additional tracking URLs that revealed targets in
China's Wuhan government and an email account also associated with the Ministry of 
Emergency Management.

The libjss.inquirerjs[.]com domain was used in December as a command and control domain
for a METALJACK phishing campaign likely targeting Southeast Asian countries.

Additional METALJACK Activity Suggests Campaigns Targeting Mandarin Speakers
Interested in COVID-19

APT32 likely used COVID-19-themed malicious attachments against Chinese speaking targets.
While we have not uncovered the full execution chain, we uncovered a METALJACK loader
displaying a Chinese-Language titled COVID-19 decoy document while launching its payload.

When the METALJACK loader, krpt.dll (MD5: d739f10933c11bd6bd9677f91893986c) is loaded,
the export "_force_link_krpt" is likely called. The loader executes one of its embedded
resources, a COVID-themed RTF file, displaying the content to the victim and saving the
document to %TEMP%.

The decoy document (Figure 2) titled 冠状病毒实时更新：中国正在追踪来⾃湖北的旅⾏者, MD5:
c5b98b77810c5619d20b71791b820529 (Translation: COVID-19 live updates: China is currently
tracking all travelers coming from Hubei Province) displays a copy of a New York Times
article to the victim.

The malware also loads shellcode in an additional resource, MD5:
a4808a329b071a1a37b8d03b1305b0cb, which contains the METALJACK payload. The
shellcode performs a system survey to collect the victim's computer name and username and
then appends those values to a URL string using libjs.inquirerjs[.]com. It then attempts to call
out to the URL. If the callout is successful, the malware loads the METALJACK payload into
memory.

It then uses vitlescaux[.]com for command and control.

The COVID-19 crisis poses an intense, existential concern to governments, and the current air of
distrust is amplifying uncertainties, encouraging intelligence collection on a scale that rivals 
armed conflict. National, state or provincial, and local governments, as well as non-government
organizations and international organizations, are being targeted, as seen in reports. Medical
research has been targeted as well, according to public statements by a Deputy Assistant
Director of the FBI. Until this crisis ends, we anticipate related cyber espionage will continue to
intensify globally.
