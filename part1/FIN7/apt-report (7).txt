IBM Security X-Force recently discovered a new malware family we have called
“Domino,” which we assess was created by developers associated with the
cybercriminal group that X-Force tracks as ITG14, also known as FIN7. Former
members of the Trickbot/Conti syndicate which X-Force tracks as ITG23 have
been using Domino since at least late February 2023 to deliver either the
Project Nemesis information stealer or more capable backdoors such as Cobalt
Strike.

This discovery highlights the intricate nature of cooperation among
cybercriminal groups and their members:

Since late February 2023, Domino Backdoor campaigns have been
observed using the Dave Loader, which we have linked to the
Trickbot/Conti syndicate and its former members.
Domino’s code shows overlap with the Lizar (aka Tirion, Diceloader)
malware family, leading us to suspect that it was created by current or
former ITG14 developers.
One of Domino’s final payloads is the Project Nemesis infostealer. Project
Nemesis was first advertised on the dark web in December 2021, though
has been rarely used since then.

Analysis

Ex-Conti Members Deploy Domino in Recent Campaigns

Former members of ITG23 (aka the Trickbot/Conti syndicate) are likely behind
recent campaigns using the Dave Loader to load Domino Backdoor and
probably collaborated with current or former ITG14 developers to purchase or
use the new malware family. X-Force previously assessed that Dave is one of
several loaders or crypters developed by members of the Trickbot/Conti group.
Although the group has fractured, many of its loaders/crypters — including
Dave — have been maintained and continue to be used by factions composed
of former Trickbot/Conti members, including Quantum, Royal, BlackBasta, and
Zeon.

The Dave Loader has been used recently with several Cobalt Strike samples
with the watermark “206546002,” which X-Force and other security
researchers — here and here — have associated with groups composed of
former members of the Trickbot/Conti syndicate, including Quantum and
Royal. X-Force observed Dave-loaded Cobalt Strike samples using this
watermark in suspected Royal attacks in fall 2022.
Dave Loader has also been used this year to load IcedID and Emotet, both
of which serve as initial access vectors for ransomware attacks from former

Trickbot/Conti-affiliated factions.

Recently observed Dave samples were discovered loading a new malware, which
we have named Domino Backdoor. This new backdoor gathers basic system
information, which it then sends to the C2, and in return receives an AES
encrypted payload.

In most instances, the received payload was a second loader that was found to
have code overlap with Domino Backdoor, and as such we have dubbed it
Domino Loader. This loader contains an encrypted payload within its resources,
which it decrypts using AES. The decrypted payload is a .NET infostealer, which
identifies itself as ‘Nemesis Project.’

The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-
joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will
be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis.

Domino’s Connections to ITG14

2023/4/17 15:48 Ex-Conti and FIN7 Actors Collaborate with New Domino Backdoor

Analysis revealed that both the Domino Backdoor and Loader share code
overlap with the Lizar Malware, also known as Tirion and DiceLoader, which is
attributed to the threat group ITG14 (FIN7). In addition to having similar coding
styles and functionality, both Domino and DiceLoader share the same
configuration structure and have similar bot ID formats. Lizar was reportedly
first used in March 2020, when it was originally named Tirion, and has been
observed in numerous ITG14 campaigns up to the end of 2022. Domino has
been active in the wild since at least October 2022, which notably is when Lizar
observations began to decrease.

X-Force researchers found additional evidence connecting Domino Backdoor to
ITG14’s Carbanak Backdoor. We identified Domino Backdoor samples from
December 2022, which used a different loader that we have dubbed
NewWorldOrder Loader. The samples used the
name ThunderboltService.exe and downloaded and loaded the Project Nemesis
Stealer.

Around the same time, we also uncovered NewWorldOrder Loader samples,
with the same filename ThunderboltService.exe, used to load the Carbanak
Backdoor. Carbanak has been used by ITG14 since late 2015.

Finally, X-Force analysts also observed that two of the Domino Backdoor C2
addresses belonging to MivoCloud: 94.158.247[.]72 and 185.225.17[.]202 are
very close to C2 addresses ITG14 has used previously for SSH-based Backdoors
such as 94.158.247[.]23 and 185.225.17[.]220. While such overlap is insufficient
for attribution, it is nonetheless consistent with other evidence linking Domino
to an ITG14 developer and may indicate the latter’s preference for MivoCloud
for at least some of their C2 addresses. MivoCloud has also been used to host
Diceloader and Carbanak C2 servers.

Collaboration between members of ITG14 and former members of ITG23 is not
without precedent. Other researchers — here and here — observed ITG14
attacks using Ryuk ransomware in 2020, which has been attributed to the
Trickbot/Conti cybercrime syndicate, while others have also identified
connections between a FIN7 developer and tools used by the BlackBasta group,
whose members also have ties to the former Trickbot/Conti syndicate.

Project Nemesis

The Project Nemesis infostealer has been active in the wild since December
2021, when it was offered for sale on several Dark Web forums. It can collect
data from a range of web browsers, as well as applications including Steam,
Telegram, Discord, crypto wallets, and VPN providers.

Domino has been used to install Project Nemesis since at least October 2022 —
prior to its use in late February 2023 by ex-Conti actors. This leads us to assess
that the ITG14 members responsible for developing Domino probably had a
relationship with Project Nemesis and offered Domino and the infostealer to the
ex-Conti threat actors as a package. The ex-Conti members in turn likely used
the Project Nemesis infostealer against lower value targets.

The use of infostealers by former Trickbot/Conti members and their distributors
is not without precedent — other security researchers observed the Vidar
infostealer delivered during DEV-0569 Batloader campaigns that also led in
some cases to Cobalt Strike and Royal ransomware. We assess that infostealers
may often be deployed during lower priority infections, e.g., on personal
computers or those not belonging to an Active Directory domain, while higher
priority infections receive other backdoors such as Cobalt Strike.

Malware Deep Dive
This section contains a deeper look at the Dave Loader, Domino Backdoor,
Domino Loader, and Project Nemesis Infostealer malware.

Dave Loader

The sample analysed for the purpose of this report is a 64-bit executable with
MD5 hash 2CC79806701F1A6E877C29B93F06F1BB and a reported compile
date of 28 February 2023. This sample is identified as a variant of Dave Loader, a
crypter linked to threat group ITG23 and more commonly observed with
payloads such as Emotet.

2023/4/17 15:48 Ex-Conti and FIN7 Actors Collaborate with New Domino Backdoor

This sample has two encrypted resources within a resource directory named
“XKLKLCRTE.” Dave Loader loads the resources using the API
calls LdrFindResource_U and LdrAccessResource, and decrypts them using
XOR and the key mh8ZqMlTsaDYBZe7ma\x00.

The smaller payload, with resource ID 3412, is a shellcode blob that contains
code designed to load a PE file. The second payload, with resource ID 6732, is a
PE file. Dave Loader executes the decrypted shellcode and passes the PE
payload to it, which the shellcode then loads and executes.

Domino Backdoor

The loaded payload is a 64-bit DLL written in Visual C++, with MD5
hash CDBE0FEB82B1CAF164C7DA42CB9A20BE. The payload was found to be
a hitherto unknown backdoor, which will be referred to as Domino Backdoor.

Upon execution, Domino Backdoor starts by generating a Bot ID for the
infected system by gathering the username and hostname and creating a hash
of the collected data, to which it then appends its current process id. For
example, a648628c13d928dc-4480. This bot ID format is similar to that
generated by Lizar, which also used a checksum of system information,
combined with the process ID. However, Lizar used a CRC algorithm to create its
hash, whereas Domino uses a custom algorithm which XOR’s multiple values
together. Interestingly, Lizar used a similar XOR-based algorithm as part of its
encryption mechanisms during communication with the C2.

The malware then proceeds to decrypt its configuration block, which is stored in
the data section of the binary. The config is decrypted using XOR and a 16-byte
key which is stored immediately before the encrypted config block. In this case
the key is {03 9B 54 72 17 D3 5E E6 E0 E9 EF E0 DF 36 0D 79}.

Fig 2 — Domino Backdoor config decryption

In the analysed sample the decrypted config contains two pipe-delimited IP
addresses, 88.119.175[.]124 and 94.158.247[.]72. This is the same format used
by Lizar to store its configuration.

A second config block, which is decrypted separately, contains an RSA public
key.

The malware generates a random 32-byte key, which it encrypts using the RSA
key. It then attempts to connect to the C2 via TCP port 443 and send the
encrypted key. Prior to the C2 connection, the malware checks whether the host

2023/4/17 15:48 Ex-Conti and FIN7 Actors Collaborate with New Domino Backdoor

system is connected to a domain. If the system is detected as being domain
joined, then the malware uses the second IP address from the config to connect
to the C2, otherwise, it defaults to the first.

If the initial connection is successful, the malware then proceeds to gather basic
system information, including username, computer name, and OS version,
which it then encrypts using AES-256-CBC and the generated, shared key (null
bytes used for IV).

An example of the unencrypted data structure, which the malware sends to the
C2, can be seen below.

The malware first sends 4 bytes to the C2 that contain a XOR-encrypted value,
which is the size of the data to follow, and then sends the AES-encrypted
system data.

The malware then begins a loop of checking in with the C2 by first sending a 4-
byte encrypted size, followed by a 16-byte AES-encrypted block, which decrypts
to the following 5 bytes {01 00 00 00 ff}. It continues this every second until it
receives a response from the C2.

When it receives a response, the malware expects the C2 to send 4 bytes
containing the payload size, followed by the payload itself. The malware then
decrypts the received payload using AES and the shared key.

The decrypted data consists of a 4 byte size, followed by a single byte indicating
either a command or the load method that the malware should use for the
payload, followed by the payload data itself, if applicable.

If the command byte is 0x3, then the malware exits.

If the command byte is 0x7, then the malware enumerates the running
processes on the system and compiles a list of process names and IDs. This data
is then encrypted using AES and returned to the C2.

Otherwise, the malware proceeds to load and execute the received payload
using the method indicated by the load/command byte. The following methods
are supported:

0x1 — Copy the payload into allocated memory within the current process
and create a new thread to execute an export
named ReflectiveLoader within the payload DLL.
0x4 — Save the payload to the %Temp% directory with a filename
generated via GetTempFileNameA, and execute the file
using CreateProcessA.
0x5, 0x6 — Open process with process id provided with the downloaded
data. Allocate space within the process and write the payload data to the
process memory. Then create a new thread in the remote process to

execute an export named ReflectiveLoader within the copied payload DLL.
This method is likely intended to be used following command 0x7.

In the case of the analysed sample, the received payload contained a DLL binary,
and command 0x1 was specified.

Fig 3 — Domino Backdoor command structure

Overlap with Lizar Toolkit

Domino Backdoor shares a lot of overlap with malware associated with the Lizar
Toolkit, which is attributed to threat group ITG14. The Lizar Toolkit consists of a
backdoor/loader, a collection of modules/plugins which can be executed by the
loader, and C2 client and server applications. A detailed report on the Lizar
Toolkit can be found here.

2023/4/17 15:48 Ex-Conti and FIN7 Actors Collaborate with New Domino Backdoor

In addition to having similar coding styles and utilising similar API calls, Domino
Backdoor uses the same configuration structure as the Lizar Loader. In both
cases, a configuration block containing a pipe-delimited list of IP addresses is
decrypted using XOR and a 16-byte key which is stored immediately before the
encrypted config.

Both malware families also generate system IDs in very similar manners. In the
case of Domino Backdoor a hash is generated from the system username and
hostname and the process ID is appended. For example, a648628c13d928dc-
4480. The hashing algorithm is custom and appears to be based on an
encryption algorithm used previously in the Lizar Loader.  Lizar Loader also
generates a system ID which consists of a hash of system data followed by the
current process ID, however, it uses a CRC algorithm to create its hash.

Domino Backdoor also incorporates elements that appear in some of Lizar’s
plugins. For example, the system information gathered by Domino Backdoor
and sent to the C2 matches the reported functionality of Lizar’s
Info32/Info64.dll plugin. Also, the function within Domino Backdoor to
enumerate running processes and send a list of process names and IDs back to
the C2 is very similar to the functionality of Lizar’s
ListProcesses32/ListProcesses64.dll plugin.

Finally, Lizar’s Jumper32/Jumper64.dll plugin resembles the code within
Domino Backdoor, which is able to load a payload using several different
methods, with the required one specified using a command ID number.

Domino Loader

The payload received by the Domino backdoor from the C2 during this analysis
was a 64-bit DLL, written in C++, with MD5
hash 2373BE26018075847AEA51636B739F66 and an internal filename
of MultiRunDll64.dll. The payload was found to be a Loader with similarities to
Domino Backdoor, and will be referred to as Domino Loader.

Domino Loader has one export named ReflectiveLoader that contains code
taken from the well-known ReflectiveDLLInjection project. When run, this code

https://securityintelligence.com/posts/ex-conti-fin7-actors-collaborate-new-domino-backdoor/ 13/24



2023/4/17 15:48 Ex-Conti and FIN7 Actors Collaborate with New Domino Backdoor

performs the steps needed to properly load the DLL into memory, and allows
for DLL payloads to load themselves directly from memory into a host process.

Once loaded, Domino Loader starts by loading an encrypted payload from its
resources and decrypting it using AES-256-CBC and a hardcoded key. The
Microsoft WinCrypt library is used for AES encryption and decryption by both
Domino Backdoor and Loader.

The decrypted data consists of 4 bytes containing the payload size, followed by
a further 4 bytes containing either the entry point offset for the payload or a
value indicating the load method which should be used, followed by the
payload itself.

If the entry point/load field contains a positive value, then the loader allocates
memory within the current process space, copies the payload data to it, and
then executes it at the specified offset indicated by the field value. This option is
most likely used for shellcode payloads or further DLLs with ReflectiveLoader
exports.

If the value of the load field is -1 then the loader allocates memory within the
current process and then loads the PE payload into it using the full PE loading
procedure. It copies the headers, maps the individual PE sections,  processes
any relocations,  loads the PE’s imports, and then executes the PE from its
internally specified entry point.

Finally, if the load field is equal to zero or another negative number, the payload
is loaded as a .NET assembly.

Nemesis Project Infostealer

The final payload loaded by Domino Loader is a .NET assembly with MD5 hash
D9FFB202D6B679E5AD7303C0334CD000 and identified as a ‘Project
Nemesis’ infostealer. Project Nemesis is a commodity malware written in .NET
which was first advertised for sale on the dark web in December 2021, though it
does not seem to be widely known and it is not frequently observed in the wild.

The sample was initially advertised with the following text:

Static Analysis

Upon execution Nemesis starts by creating a mutex to ensure only one instance
of the malware is running: Local\\751E355F-B066-4547-B13E-B185D9176390

The malware keeps a log of its activity, mostly written in the Russian language,
and the following is written upon its startup:

Logger.Write(“~[NEMESIS INIZIALIZE]~”);
Logger.Write(“Запуск задачи EngineTask”);

transfers back to the C2.

A Tangled Web Provides Opportunities
This analysis highlights the intricate relationships between cybercriminal groups
and their members. Domino Backdoor shares code overlap with the Lizar (aka
Tirion, Diceloader) family of malware, developed by ITG14. Since late February
2023, former members of ITG23 have been observed using Dave Loader with
Domino Backdoor during their campaigns, suggesting at least some level of
collaboration between the two groups. The use of malware with ties to multiple
groups in a single campaign — such as Dave Loader, Domino Backdoor and
Project Nemesis Infostealer — highlights the complexity involved in tracking
threat actors but also provides insight into how and with whom they operate.
