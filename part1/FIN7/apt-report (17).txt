Rare BadUSB attack detected in the wild against US hospitality
provider

Hackers use snail-mail to send target company an envelope with a malware-laced
USB thumb drive.

A US hospitality provider has recently been the target of an incredibly rare BadUSB attack,
ZDNet has learned from cyber-security firm Trustwave.

The attack happened after the company received an envelope containing a fake BestBuy
gift card, along with a USB thumb drive.

The receiving company was told to plug the USB thumb drive into a computer to access a
list of items the gift card could be used for.

But in reality, the USB thumb drive was what security experts call a "BadUSB" -- a USB
thumb drive that actually functions as a keyboard when connected to a computer, where it
emulates keypresses to launch various automated attacks.

Trustwave, who couldn't reveal the target company's name for confidentiality reasons, said
the victim recognized the attempted hack and called it in to investigate the incident.

In a report published today (https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/would-you-

exchange-your-security-for-a-gift-card/) and shared with ZDNet, Trustwave said that once they
plugged the BadUSB into a test workstation, the BadUSB triggered a series of automated
keypresses that launched a PowerShell command.

This Powershell command downloaded a bulkier PowerShell script from an internet site and
then installed malware on the test machine -- a JScript-based bot.

"At the time of the analysis, we did not found a similar strain of malware," Phil Hay, Senior
Research Manager at Trustwave, told ZDNet in an email yesterday.

"The malware is unknown to us. It is also hard to say if it is custom-built, but it probably is,
because it is not wide spread and seems to be targeted," Hay added.

However, the Trustwave researcher also told us that since their initial analysis, a file similar
to the malware they analyzed
(https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7be4f1309d52ae8b0e710caedf8b49f044d5e9bbb20b40b4d8bbe9b77818483b

was later uploaded on VirusTotal, a web-based file scanning engine. Per subsequent
analysis from Facebook (https://twitter.com/michael_yip/status/1243168680650964998) and Kaspersky
(https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1243167791483686913) researchers, the file is believed to be the work
of a hacking group known as FIN7 (https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/anunak).

It is unclear who uploaded this file, or if it comes from another cyber-security vendor also
investigating a BadUSB attack at another victim.

But the lesson here is that someone actually detected a BadUSB attack in the real world.
BadUSB attacks were first detailed at the start of the 2010s, and for many years they
represented a theoretical attack scenario, something that employees are often warned
about, but which has rarely been seen in the wild.

"These sorts of [BadUSB] attacks are often simulated in penetration testing and used during
red teaming exercises," Hay told ZDNet. "Seeing these types of attacks in the real world is
much more rare."

An FBI spokesperson told ZDNet that any users or companies who receive malware-laced
USBs should report the incident to their local FBI office for further investigations.

LAST KNOWN ATTACK HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO IN EASTERN EUROPE

The last known case of a BadUSB attack (https://www.zdnet.com/article/eastern-european-banks-lose-

tens-of-millions-of-dollars-in-hollywood-style-hacks/) -- also known as a Bash Bunny attack -- was
detailed in December 2018 by Russian cyber-security firm Kaspersky.

At the time, the company said it found BadUSB devices, along with cheap laptops and
Raspberry Pi boards, on location at eight banks in Eastern Europe. The banks called
