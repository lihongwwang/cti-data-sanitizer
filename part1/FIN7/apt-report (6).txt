latest findings:

We have added information regarding the file “445.ps1”, which was missing at the
time of writing.
We have updated this blogpost to broaden our attribution from FIN7 to FIN7 or a
threat actor utilizing FIN7 tradecraft.

 
Introduction

WithSecure Intelligence identified attacks which occurred in late March 2023
against internet-facing servers running Veeam Backup & Replication software. Our
research indicates that the intrusion set used in these attacks has overlaps with

those attributed to the FIN7 activity group. It is likely that initial access & execution
was achieved through a recently patched Veeam Backup & Replication vulnerabil‐
ity, CVE-2023-27532[1].

FIN7 is a financially motivated cybercrime group with roots dating back to mid-
2010s. The group has been involved in several high-profile, large-scale attacks
over the years. The group’s tradecraft and modus operandi have evolved over their
multi-year history, developing new tools[2], expanding their operations[3], as well
as affiliating with other threat actors[4].

This blogpost provides an analysis of intrusions we have observed, along with a
timeline of these attacks.

 

Initial activity

On 28th March 2023, initial activity was observed across internet-facing servers
running Veeam Backup & Replication software. An SQL server process
“sqlservr.exe” related to the Veeam Backup instance executed a shell command,
which performed in-memory download and execution of a PowerShell script.

Figure1:Example of shell command launched via sqlservr.exe

Our analysis found that all instances of these PowerShell scripts were
POWERTRASH. POWERTRASH is an obfuscated loader written in PowerShell
that has been attributed to FIN7. The script contains an embedded payload that is
executed through reflective PE injection. The filenames (e.g. icsnd16_64refl.ps1,
icbt11801_64refl.ps1) used for these PowerShell scripts were also (notably) identi‐
cal to the naming convention reportedly used by FIN7[7]

 

Figure2:POWERTRASH script code snippet

In the past[2], POWERTRASH has been used to execute various payloads, includ‐
ing Carbanak, DICELOADER, and Cobalt Strike. The embedded payload in the in‐
cidents we observed in March was DICELOADER, also known as Lizar.
DICELOADER is a backdoor linked to FIN7. The operators made use of
DICELOADER to gain a foothold in compromised machines to conduct post-ex‐
ploitation procedures.

The exact method used by the threat actor to invoke the initial shell commands re‐
mains unknown but was likely achieved through a recently patched Veeam Backup
& Replication vulnerability, CVE-2023-27532, which can provide unauthenticated
access to a Veeam Backup & Replication instance. However, as there were no

concrete indicators to confirm these findings, this remains a low-to-medium confi‐
dence assessment based on the following:

The affected servers had TCP open port 9401 exposed to the internet. This port is
used for communication with the Veeam Backup Service over SSL. Network activity
with an external IP address was observed over this port right before the shell
command invocation by the SQL server instance process.
CVE-2023-27532 was patched a few weeks prior to this campaign. Exploitation of
this vulnerability requires communication over port 9401.
The servers were running vulnerable versions of the software at the time of attack.
A proof-of-concept[5] (POC) exploit was made publicly available a few days prior to
the campaign, on 23rd March 2023. The POC contains remote command
execution functionality. The remote command execution, which is achieved
through SQL shell commands, yields the same execution chain observed in this
campaign.

It is worth noting that a few days prior to the initial attack, additional suspicious ac‐
tivity was observed on the servers that we investigated. On 24th March 2023, the
SQL server process for Veeam backup instances executed another shell command
to copy the “Web.config” file located within Veeam Backup & Replication program
files to another file called “system.js”. The exact reason for this shell command re‐
mains unknown and no strong evidence links this earlier activity to the intrusions.
However, it is plausible that the earlier activity was performed by the threat actor to
probe and identify internet-facing servers vulnerable to CVE-2023-2753 as part of
large-scale vulnerability scanning, something that FIN7 has reportedly done in the
past[7].

Reconnaissance, Discovery, and Credential theft

The threat actor used a series of commands as well as custom scripts to gather
host and network information from the compromised machines. Some of these
commands included:

netstat   : Display all active TCP connections and listening ports
tasklist   : Display all running processes
ipconfig : Display all IP configurations

Furthermore, a series of SQL commands were executed to steal information from
the Veeam backup database.

 

Figure4:SQL commands for credential theft
 

The threat actor also used a PowerShell script to retrieve stored credentials. The
script content is identical to a code snippet shared online for retrieving passwords
from Veeam Backup Servers[6].

Figure 5:Script to retrieve passwords from server
 

A custom PowerShell script was executed through lateral movement to gather op‐
erating system information on the target through the usage of WMI. The content of
the script and the execution method is identical to activity associated with FIN7[4].

 

Figure6:Recon
 

To resolve the list of collected IP addresses to their respective host names, a cus‐
tom PowerShell script, “host_ip.ps1”, was executed. The PowerShell script content
is nearly identical to a code snippet shared online for resolving IP to Hostname with
PowerShell[8]. ”host_ip.ps1” file name has been reportedly observed in FIN7’s at‐
tack arsenal[7].

An additional file called “445.ps1” was dropped and executed on the compromised
Veeam backup servers. The retrieved script content functions as a port checker,
which tests whether a port is open for a given address by attempting to establish a
socket connection for a set of IP address and port pairs from an input file.

Setting up persistence

A custom PowerShell script, “gup18.ps1”, was executed to set up an active
foothold in the compromised machine by creating a persistence mechanism to ex‐
ecute DICELOADER on device startup. This script was hosted on an external file-
hosting service “temp[.]sh”. This unique PowerShell script has not been previously
seen in the attack arsenal of FIN7, and we are now tracking it as POWERHOLD.

Figure9:POWERHOLD code snippet
 

The PowerShell script drops 7 files, which are embedded in the script content, into
a unique folder in %APPDATA%, and sets an autorun registry entry to establish
persistence. The dropped files are:

gup.exe – Legitimate GUP.exe binary (part of the Notepad++ application)
gup.xml – Configuration file that’s part of the GUP application
libcurl.dll - .NET DLL file side-loaded by gup.exe
JZ4qWKZW – Encoded DICELOADER payload that’s loaded and executed by
libcurl.dll
jkBDfXaL.bat – Batch file that executes gup.exe
0JNvHvAz.vbs – VBScript file that executes the batch file

Figure10:Execution chain of POWERHOLD
 

libcurl.dll, which is side-loaded by gup.exe, is a simple .NET loader that decodes
and executes an on-disk payload that has been XORed. The on-disk payload file‐
name as well as XOR key are hardcoded within the loader. This unique loader has
not been previously seen in FIN7’s attack arsenal, and we are now tracking it as
DUBLOADER.

It is worth noting that the legitimate libcurl.dll used by GUP.exe is meant to be a
native link library file, while the malicious variant used by the threat actor is a .NET
DLL file. The crafted loader is designed to mimic the legitimate libcurl.dll file by in‐
cluding export function names found in the legitimate version and thus imported by
the GUP executable. Only one of the export functions, namely “curl_easy_init”
contains malicious code. All other export functions are trivially implemented with
“retn 0” instructions. The “curl_easy_init” export function, which implements the
malicious code, is the first function[9] from the library that is called by the GUP ex‐
ecutable. Therefore, the malicious code is executed immediately when GUP.exe is
launched.

Lateral Movement

The threat actor performed a series of remote WMI method invocations as well as
‘net share’ commands to test for lateral movement on a target host with the exfil‐
trated credentials. A few hours after issuing these commands, the threat actor re‐
turned to perform a successful lateral movement.

Lateral tool transfer was achieved through the usage of SMB to drop two
PowerShell scripts into the remote host’s ADMIN$ share. Execution was achieved
through remote service creation.

Figure13:Remote Service execution
 

The threat actor launched a custom PowerShell script (explained above) to gather
information about the target host. This was followed by the execution of another
PowerShell script, which was another POWERTRASH sample. This script per‐
formed remote injection into the ‘PlugPlay’ service, which made a network connec‐
tion to a remote host on port 443. While we were unable to fetch the full contents of
the secondary script to determine the exact payload used, we believe the payload
was likely another backdoor/command-and-control agent (i.e., a CobaltStrike bea‐
con). The command line patterns were previously seen in activity associated with
FIN7[4].

Outlook and Implications

WithSecure Intelligence has so far identified two instances of such attacks con‐
ducted by FIN7 or a threat actor utilizing FIN7 tradecraft. As the initial activity
across both instances were initiated from the same public IP address on the same
day, it is likely that these incidents were part of a larger campaign. However, given
the probable rarity of Veeam backup servers with TCP port 9401 publicly exposed,
we believe the scope of this attack is limited.

Nonetheless, we advise affected companies to follow the recommendations and
guidelines to patch and configure their backup servers appropriately as outlined in
