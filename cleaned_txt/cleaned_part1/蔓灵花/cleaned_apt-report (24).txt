Bitter APT Group Using “Dracarys” Android Spyware
Android Malware Disguised As A Messaging Application

During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across an article wherein the researchers mentioned Bitter APT delivering the Android Spyware “Dracarys.” Bitter aka T-APT-17 is a well-known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group active since 2013 and operates in South Asia. It has been observed targeting China, India, Pakistan, and other countries in South Asia.
The Bitter APT is actively involved in both desktop and mobile malware campaigns and uses techniques like spear phishing emails, exploiting known vulnerabilities to deliver Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and other malware families.
Dracarys Android Spyware impersonates genuine applications such as Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and other chat applications and distributes through phishing sites.
During analysis, we observed that one of the phishing sites is still live and distributing Dracarys. The phishing site mimics the genuine Signal site and delivers a trojanized Signal app.
Upon in-depth analysis of the malware, we observed that the Threat Actor (TA) had inserted the malicious code into the Signal app source code to avoid being detected. The below image showcases the extra added spyware module “org.zcode.dracarys” in the trojanized version of the Signal App.

Technical Analysis
APK Metadata Information
App Name: Signal
Package Name: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.app
SHA256 Hash: d16a9b41a1617711d28eb52b89111b2ebdc25d26fa28348a115d04560a9f1003

Manifest Description
The malicious application mentions 24 permissions, of which the TA exploits 10. The harmful permissions requested by the malware are:
Permission Description
READ_CONTACTS Access phone contacts
RECEIVE_SMS Allows an application to receive SMS messages
READ_SMS Access phone messages
CAMERA Required to access the camera device.
READ_CALL_LOG Access phone call logs
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to read the contents of the device’s external storage
RECORD_AUDIO Allows the app to record audio with the microphone, which the attackers can misuse
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of the device
CALL_PHONE Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the call
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION Allows an app to access precise location

Source Code Review
The trojanized version of the Signal application has registered the Accessibility Service in the Manifest file. The malware abuses the Accessibility permissions such as auto granting permission to run the application in the background, activating Device Admin, and performing auto clicks.
The malware connects to the Firebase server and receives the commands to execute operations for collecting the data from the victim’s device, as shown in the below image.
The malware collects all the contacts from the infected device and sends them to the Command and Control (C&C) server “hxxps://signal-premium-app[.]org“.
Similarly, the malware collects SMS data, call logs, installed applications list, and files present on the infected device after receiving a command from the C&C server.
The malware registers the “DracarysReceiver” broadcast receiver, which receives the event from the Firebase server and starts collecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data from the infected device.
The malware can capture screenshots and record audio to spy on the victim’s device. The below figure shows the code used by the malware to send captured screenshots and recordings to its C&C server.
The image below shows the C&C server and the URL path to which the stolen data is sent.

Conclusion
According to our research, the TA has injected malicious code into genuine messaging applications such as Signal. The TA also distributed the malware through a phishing site masquerading as a genuine website that tricks users into downloading a trojanized version of popular messaging applications.
We have observed Bitter APT continuously attacking South Asian countries and changing its mode of attack with each new campaign. In this campaign, Bitter APT used a sophisticated phishing attack to infect devices with Dracarys Android Spyware.
In the coming days, we may observe a change in the Bitter APT group’s activities, with different malware variants, enhanced techniques, and distribution modes.
