German Embassy Lure: Likely Part of Campaign
Against NATO Aligned Ministries of Foreign Affairs
EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that two observed PDF documents are
part of an ongoing campaign targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs of NATO aligned
countries. The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and
contained two diplomatic invitation lures.

Executive Summary

EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that two observed PDF
documents are part of an ongoing campaign targeting Ministries of Foreign
Affairs of NATO aligned countries. The PDF files masquerade as coming from
the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures. 

One of the PDFs delivered a variant of Duke - a malware that has been linked to
Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage activities of APT29. The other file
was very likely used for testing or reconnaissance, as it did not contain a
payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment.  

Victimology, lure documents, malware delivery and the malware itself resemble
with reports that have linked the campaign to APT29, an advanced persistent
threat actor attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

The threat actor used Zulip - an open-source chat application - for command-
and-control, to evade and hide its activities behind legitimate web traffic. 
 
Malicious PDF Document Used to Deliver HTML Smuggling 

EclecticIQ analysts identified two malicious PDF documents that masquerade
as coming from the German embassy, and that targeted diplomatic entities
with invitation lures. The documents used the following themes: “Farewell to
Ambassador of Germany” and “Day of German Unity”. The first PDF contained
embedded JavaScript code to deliver multi-staged payloads in HTML file
format. PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat have a default setting that warns
before execution of code inside a PDF document. Upon user execution the PDF
document displays an “Open File” alert box. If a victim opens it, the
code will launch the malicious HTML file called Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB.

The German embassy invitation lure. The mailto address inside
the PDF file refers to a legitimate domain bahamas.gov.bs. Analysts observed
the same domain in a report by Lab52 from mid-July. Lab52 initially
reported a campaign impersonating the Norwegian embassy and targeting
diplomatic entities with invitation lures.

Analysts assess with high confidence that the PDF files impersonating the
German embassy, were very likely created by the same threat actor, due to
overlaps in the victimology, and phishing themes used.

invitation lure PDF, which was generated by PyPDF2.

Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB is an HTML file. Through HTML smuggling,
the threat actor delivered a ZIP file that contained a malicious HTML
Application (HTA). An HTA file is a widely used Living Off The Land Binary
(LOLBIN) containing both HTML and scripting code to create a standalone
malicious application that is executed by the Windows HTA engine
mshta.exe. The zipped HTA file eventually delivers a Duke malware
variant.

The JavaScript code inside the
Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB.html. The URL sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-
content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p) was controlled by the threat actor to
receive the execution file path by using window.location.pathname, which
provides the username of the victim device and notifies the threat actor of
possible successful attack.

execution of PDF lure document.

DLL Sideloading Abused to Execute Duke Variant Malware 

After execution, the HTA file will drop the three executables into the
C:\Windows\Tasks directory for DLL Sideloading:

•    AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll - A library loaded into msoev.exe to perform
the execution without any failure.
•    Mso.dll - Duke malware variant loaded into msoev.exe via DLL
Sideloading.
•    Msoev.exe - A legitimate signed Windows binary, automatically loading
Mso.dll and AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll upon execution.

DLL Sideloading attempt into Msoev.exe. 

Windows API Hashing Used to Hide Import Address Table

EclecticIQ analysts examined the dropped Duke malware variant (mso.dll).
Analysis showed that the malware used Windows API hashing to hide the
names of the Windows API function calls. The actor used this technique to
perform evasion against static malware scanners.

The decoded Windows libraries from ROR13 hashing algorithm: 

•    Kernel32.dll: 6A4ABC5B
•    Ntdll.dll: 3CFA685D
•    User32.dll: 63C84283

XOR Encryption to Hide String Values

Analysts observed that all string values are encrypted by generic XOR
encryption routines that are decrypted at execution. An
example of a decrypted function inside the mso.dll, which is used to open the
lure Invitation.pdf. The malware uses ShellExecuteA Windows API to open the
PDF lure document. String data such as Invitation.pdf is stored statically inside
the malware as XOR encrypted stack string.

XOR decryption of the byte array and it’s using last byte of encrypted array as
a key to decrypt it.

Zulip: Hiding C2 Communication in Legitimate Web Traffic

EclecticIQ analysts observed that threat actor used Zulip servers to establish a
C2 connection, and to blend with legitimate web traffic. Zulip is an open-
source chat application that uses Amazon web services to receive and send
chat messages. The actor used the API features of Zulip to send victim details
to an actor-controlled chat room (toyy[.]zulipchat[.]com), and to issue
malicious remote commands.

C2 communications from toyy[.]zulipchat[.]com. 

All of the API request headers such as URL, authorization token, and the
request itself are stored encrypted inside the Duke malware variant. The
decrypted contents can be seen in Appendix A below.

Pivoted PDF Document Notifies Threat Actor About Success
Rate

Pivoting on parameters in the previously identified URL - sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-
content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p)- analysts identified a second PDF file. The
PDF used a “Day of German Unity” lure. Analysts assess with
moderate confidence that the PDF document was very likely used by the threat
actor for reconnaissance or for testing purposes. It did not contain a payload,
but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment by receiving a
notification through a compromised domain edenparkweddings[.]com.

Attribution

EclecticIQ Analysts assess with high confidence that the identified pdf
documents are part of a wider campaign targeting diplomatic corps across the
globe. Victimology, themes of the phishing lures, malware delivery and the
malware itself resemble with OSINT reports that attributed the campaign to
APT29.

Diamond Model of this campaign.

APT29 also known as CozyBear, The Dukes, Cloaked Ursa, Nobelium,
UNC2452 is an advanced persistent threat actor (APT) active since 2008.
The US and UK governments attribute APT29 to Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR), which is responsible for the collection of
political and economic intelligence from foreign countries.

The Duke malware variant was first described by F-Secure, and EclecticIQ
analysts identified code similarities in the recent sample.

APT29 is known to abuse legitimate web services such as Microsoft
OneDrive and Notion APIs to perform command-and-control
communication (C2) in an evasive way. In this new campaign the threat
actor used Zulip web services as C2. 

APT29’s primary targets are governments and government
subcontractors, political organizations, research firms, and critical
industries such as energy, healthcare, education, finance, and technology
in the US and Europe. APT29 primarily intends to disrupt national security,
impact critical infrastructure, and cause political interference

Protection and Mitigation Strategies
Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention
systems (IPS) or any network defence mechanisms to alert and block
suspicious network traffic going through unexpected web services.

Use YARA rules provided in Appendix B to search Windows endpoints for
potential Duke malware variant infections.

Implement an application allow-list policy on Windows hosts to prevent
potential execution of LOLBINs like msoev.exe.
