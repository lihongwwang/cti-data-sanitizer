Doppelgänger NG | Russian Cyberwarfare campaign  

Executive Summary 
ClearSky Cyber Security1 and SentinelLabs2 have discovered a new wave of Russian information 
warfare campaign named Doppelgänger NG. Meta exposed the infrastructure of "Doppelgänger” 
campaign in 20223, and RecordedFuture research enhanced meta findings in 20234. 
"Doppelgänger" (meaning spirit double, an exact but usually invisible replica) is a global 
information warfare campaign publishing false information on hundreds of fake websites and 
social media channels. 
Our research revealed that "Doppelgänger NG" is again fully operational in 2024, using new 
infrastructure. Furthermore, we found a link between the "Doppelgänger NG" Campaign and the 
Russian cyber espionage group APT28. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear and STRONTIUM) is a 
notorious Russian state-sponsored group that has been active since at least 2004. For over a 
decade APT28 has been conducting cyber intrusions against critical targets worldwide, to 
advance Russian interests. 
The link to APT28 is based on similarities of text and code strings, found in "Doppelgänger NG” 
campaign and in a prior campaign uncovered by CERT-UA, attributed to APT28.  
Russian influence campaigns like the “Doppelgänger” Campaign are part of the Russian hybrid 
war strategy. 
The Main principles of Russia Hybrid Warfare Strategy are: 

1) A blending of conventional military force, cyberattacks, information warfare, 
propaganda, economic pressure, political subversion, and proxies to achieve geopolitical 
goals. 

2) Obfuscation of Russian involvement, seeking deniability. Uses non-state groups, 
militants, hackers, and bots as proxies.   

3) Weaponizes disruption - spreading chaos, confusion, and distrust - targeting adversaries' 
social cohesion.

Russian IW (Information Warfare) aims to shape international perceptions, political discourse, and 
policy directions around the world by exploiting social networks, news websites and anonymity. 
Several Kremlin-aligned objectives are being pursued by Russia's IW efforts, including influencing 
US election campaigns, weakening European Union cohesion, and reducing Western backing for 
Ukraine. 
Russia has invested in numerous Information Warfare influence campaigns around the world over 
the past decade. Starting from an influence campaign affiliated with the 2016 US elections and 
European political and policy-related organizations in September 2020[ 5 ,, [ 6 ,, through a 
"Russosphere" campaign in Africa in February 2023, which promoted pan-African and anti-
colonial sentiments while advocating their close relationship with the Russian far right [7,, as well 
as an anti-American and anti-NATO campaign in Latin America8 in November 2023. Appendix 1 
contains more information about IW campaigns. 
 

Key Findings 
• We uncovered new infrastructure used by “Doppelgänger NG”, probably because their 

old infrastructure was uncovered in the Recorded Future report. 
• We discovered a potential link between APT28 to “Doppelgänger NG” campaign based on 

several similarities found in the CERT-UA report. 
• The “Doppelgänger NG” campaign has expanded its victims list, including new targets in 

the US, Germany, Israel, and France. 
• The “Doppelgänger NG” network contains more than 150 domains, including news feeds 

relevant to five countries (United State, Israel, France, Germany, Ukraine).  
• A huge investment was required in human resources, technology, and computing 

infrastructure to support such a large campaign. Only state organizations can invest in IW 
in this magnitude. 

• “Doppelgänger NG” is an ongoing campaign. A successful IW campaign relies on long 
continuity. The reliability of a website grows over time; credibility and audience are 
strengthened by the website’s reputation. When a site becomes popular and legitimate, 
engineered, and false messages become harder to detect. These messages affect 
people’s actions as well as the society in which they are embedded.

Campaign Analysis 
This chapter presents the analysis of the campaign, during which two new findings were 
identified: 

1. A link between the Doppelgänger NG campaign to the Russian APT28 group. 
2. New infrastructure. 

A link between the Doppelgänger campaign to the Russian APT28 

On January 24th, 2024, a file was uploaded to VirusTotal accompanied by a note stating that it 
had been used in a phishing campaign targeting the Ukrainian government. CERT-UA has linked 
this file to the Russian APT28.9 Below are the file’s details: 

File name: detail[.,html 
File type: HTML 
Sha256: 33c208cf0bafe98f0fc4ab9e7a3ddf25e2218d0bce01d6844780782a16ccab2f 
Sha1: 3e563f05dd9e315c33791ecd55b384f47662b89d 
Md5: 48d091b7601143e490aa7eef359010e2 
Below is the accompanied note from VirusTotal: 

Examining the file details[.,html revealed three unique strings:  

A search for files that contain all three unique strings yielded four new files. Out of the four files 
with the three strings embedded, two were attributed to APT28 as reported by CERT-UA. The 
other two files are part of the code of the Ukraine “Doppelgänger” website rbk[.,media. 
Below is a screenshot of the above mentioned five files that contain the same three unique 
strings. Files attributed to the APT28 campaign are marked in BLUE. Files that were downloaded 
from a domain attributed to the Doppelgänger campaign by Recorded Future are marked in 
RED. 

Analyzing the second file in the list above revealed a Google Analytics ID embedded in the file 
and associated with two domains. One of them (rbc[.,ua) is a legitimate domain, while the other 
one (rbk[.,media) impersonates the legitimate domain. The impersonating domain was 
attributed to the Doppelgänger campaign by Recorded Future. Below are the details of the 
second file: 
File name: zelenskomu-nuzhna-ocherednaja-mjasorubka[.,php (translation: “Zelensky-needs-
another-meat-grinder”) 
File type: JavaScript 
Sha256: e079961f8556b5fc0c3bdc0e4dd1558ccb775be4d80ae847b26cda0658b85373 
Sha1: eaf62ade86350b658d68973a5299de82e25de759 
Md5: 11b44c0ffce780a3ce48a641431d0ad0 

The file was first submitted to VirusTotal on January 28th, 2024, and it is not flagged as malicious 
by any security vendors or sandboxes. The file belongs to the domain rbk[.,media. 
Searching for a unique identifier embedded in the file revealed the Google Analytics ID shown in 
the screenshot below: 

Examining the Google Analytics ID yielded two results: the recently registered domain 
rbk[.,media, and the domain rbc[.,ua. It seems that rbk[.,media impersonates rbc[.,ua, as the 
same ID was used by Google Analytics for both domains. 

The potential correlation, while not conclusive given the nature of HTML code fragments, 
suggests a possible connection. This encourages further investigation, fostering the prospect of 
uncovering additional links between the doppelgänger campaign and APT28.  

Uncovering New Infrastructure 

Further investigation into the domains linked to the impersonating domain, rbk[.,media, 
uncovered new infrastructure related to the campaign. It appears that following the campaign's 
initial exposure in December 2023, the infrastructure was shifted to a new primary domain, 
sdgqaef[.,site. Most of the domains related to the campaign are now redirected through this new 
domain. 
 
Infrastructure research details 
Research into scans of the domain, rbk[.,media, revealed chains of redirects leading to the 
“Doppelgänger” domain. This structure is consistent with the RecordedFuture report – with two 
notable differences: 

1. A new primary root domain which all news sites are connected to – sdgqaef[.,site, has 
replaced the previous domain, ggspace[.,space. 

2. After Stage 2, there is a divergence, where in some cases the victim is redirected to a fake 
site, while in others, to a legitimate site. 

Following is a short explanation on the redirection stages:  
▪ The first-stage websites, which Doppelgänger distributes on Twitter(X), use thumbnail 

images hosted at telegra[.,ph to obfuscate the website thumbnails and redirect to 
second-stage sites. 

▪ The second-stage websites contain random text (probably used to make the hash 
unique) and execute a JavaScript code obfuscated using Base64-encoding. The 
JavaScript code samples issue a request to sdgqaef[.,site. The request includes tracking 
information, which is likely a campaign identifier. These are in the format of [country,-
[day,-[month,_[domain,, where [domain, refer to the domain hosting the destination 
article (US-16-02_Shadowwatch for an article hosted at shadowwatch[.,us). 

Redirect Diagram 

Below is another example for the chain of redirects stages: 

Detecting the primary domain from which all other domains are redirected was done by 
investigating the script downloaded in Stage 2. Below is a screenshot of an example script: 

Within the div class=”content” section, there is a sentence in English that can be read. The 
meaning of this sentence is unclear. We asses that it is intended to give the JavaScript a unique 
characteristic. The purpose of this uniqueness is probably to raise the persistence level of the 
campaign. 
At the bottom of the script, there is a base64-encoded string. After decoding it, the code is 
revealed, and the new primary domain embedded in it is uncovered. The script remained 
unchanged. Below are screenshots of the identical script with the new and old domains: 

Research into the first seen date of the new main domain revealed that there is an overlap 
between the first seen date and the initial exposure date of the campaign. The first seen date 
was on December 7, 2023. It appears that following the campaign's initial exposure in December 
2023, the infrastructure was shifted to a new primary domain. 

Indicators of Compromise 
Due to the extensive volume of observed indicators, we present here only a selection, including 

indicators from parallel campaigns targeting France alongside those targeting German 

audiences.

Appendix 1 
Russia's Hybrid Warfare Strategy 
The overall strategy combines kinetic and non-kinetic action spanning multiple domains and 
blends state resources with private entities and proxies to pursue Russian geopolitical 
dominance led by Putin's inner circle. This strategy is led by the Kremlin and supported by state 
intelligence services.  
Main principles of Russia Hybrid Warfare Strategy 

1) A blending of conventional military force, cyberattacks, information warfare, 
propaganda, economic pressure, political subversion, and proxies to achieve geopolitical 
goals. 

2) Obfuscation of Russian involvement, seeking deniability. Uses non-state groups, 
militants, hackers, and bots as proxies.   

3) Weaponizes disruption - spreading chaos, confusion, and distrust - targeting adversaries' 
social cohesion. 

Key Russian Hybrid Warfare strategy Leaders: 
1) Valery Gerasimov - Chief of Russian General Staff. Key promoter of modern Russian 

hybrid warfare, now known as the "Gerasimov doctrine."   
2) Sergey Naryshkin - Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Long-time 

Putin ally overseeing espionage and disinformation operations.  
3) Igor Kostyukov - Director of Main Directorate of the General Staff, Russia's military 

intelligence agency (GRU). Oversees cyber ops and covert action teams. 
4) Aleksandr Dugin - Political scientist and fascist ideologue providing much of the 

reactionary ideology behind Russian information warfare narratives. 
5) Yevgeny Prigozhin – Was an oligarch with close Putin ties. Established the Internet 

Research Agency "troll factory" and Wagner mercenary group. 

Here is a brief overview of some of Russia's major information warfare and disinformation 
campaigns in recent years: 

• 2016 US Presidential Election: Russia engaged in a coordinated campaign to interfere in 
the 2016 US presidential election through hacked and leaked emails, social media 
disinformation, and amplification of divisive content. This included the hack and release 
of Democratic party emails and widespread social media disinformation. 

• War in Ukraine: Since the conflict began in 2014, Russia has consistently spread false 
narratives and conspiracy theories about Ukraine and the West's role there. This includes 
allegations of fascism in the Ukrainian government, a Western-backed coup in 2014, and 
the downing of flight MH17 being a false flag operation. 

• COVID-19 Pandemic: Russian state media and social media accounts heavily promoted 
misinformation about COVID-19, including the virus's origins and false treatment claims. 
This was seen as an effort to sow distrust in public health efforts and institutions.  

• Anti-Western Narratives: Russian state media frequently promotes anti-US and anti-
European narratives, criticizing the decline of Western values, social tensions related to 
issues like immigration, and alleging Western aggression toward Russia. These aim to 
portray Russia as morally superior. 

• Syrian Civil War: Russia provided significant material support to Syria while also running 
targeted disinformation campaigns to bolster the Assad regime, criticize Western 
involvement, and attempt to shape perceptions around chemical weapons use and war 
crimes allegations.  

• Domestic Control: Inside Russia, the government employs censorship, surveillance, 
restrictive internet laws, and propaganda to control narratives and suppress opposition 
voices. Independent media outlets have faced severe restrictions. 

The Wagner Group has been linked to some Russian information and disinformation operations, 
especially in Africa. While Wagner mercenaries conduct physical military-style operations, 
coordinated online propaganda and disinformation campaigns often boost their narrative as 
part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy globally. Attribution comes from analysing patterns of 
inauthentic account networks supportive of Wagner and the Kremlin's geopolitical goals. Here 
are some examples of their attribution: 

1) Central African Republic (CAR) - In CAR, where Wagner operatives have been active since 
2018, social media disinformation has been used to whitewash their activities and 
reinforce a pro-Russian narrative. Researchers found fake Facebook and Twitter accounts 
pushing pro-Wagner propaganda, while attacking France and other European actors. 

2) Libya - Similar patterns were seen on social media in relation to Wagner activities in 
support of Russian ally Khalifa Haftar in eastern Libya. This included fake accounts as 
well as coordinated messaging between authentic pro-Haftar accounts. These promoted 
Russia's role in Libya and dismissed human rights criticisms.   

3) Mozambique - Observers have highlighted a Russian disinformation and propaganda 
campaign supporting the deployment of Wagner forces to Mozambique to combat an 
Islamic extremist insurgency. Fabricated accounts and suspect websites circulated false 
allegations against Western involvement.  

4) Sudan - Wagner contract soldiers are reportedly operating in Sudan, while Russian 
campaigns promote closer Russia-Sudan ties. In 2020, Facebook took down a Russian 
influence operation focused heavily on Sudan that featured Wagner-linked fake accounts.
