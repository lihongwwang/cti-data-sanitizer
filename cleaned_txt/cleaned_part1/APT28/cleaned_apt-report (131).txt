Background
There has been some recent news regarding further activities of a group variously described as Sofacy. We are releasing this flash bulletin containing network indicators to aid security professionals in detecting this activity.

Recent Reports
In the past few days Trend Micro and FireEye have both released reports relating to similar activity:
Trend Micro described spear phishes containing links to malicious websites that deploy malware through apparent browser exploits and phishing for web-mail credentials.
FireEye have recently described the use of CVE-2015-3043 and CVE-2015-1701 exploits in suspected Sofacy attacks.
Interestingly, despite the use of zero-day exploits for delivery, there is some evidence that the attackers continue to use old variants of their malware.

Network Indicators
Below we list a number of domains which you may wish to review network logs for. Typically registered domains are employed for phishing and/or malware command and control. This is a redacted list of domains that are likely related to Sofacy and we note that related domains have been observed by others, as well as in the cited reports.
